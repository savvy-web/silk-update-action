/**
 * Build-time guard: the config-dependency module import must survive bundling as
 * a genuine runtime `import()`.
 *
 * `src/services/module-catalogs.ts` imports a config dependency's extracted
 * tarball entry from a path computed at runtime. Without the inline
 * `/* webpackIgnore: true *\/` magic comment, rspack compiles that call into a
 * context module (a build-time directory glob) and the action throws
 * `Cannot find module 'file:///…'` at runtime even though the file is on disk.
 *
 * That failure is invisible to vitest — it runs the TypeScript source, not the
 * bundle — and invisible to typecheck and lint. It only appears in the shipped
 * `dist/main.js`. So it is asserted here, against the built artifact, on every
 * build (`pnpm build`, `pnpm build:prod`, `pnpm ci:build` and CI's build step
 * all run `build:prod`, which invokes this script).
 *
 * The assertion anchors on the *call site*, not on any message near it: the two
 * statements
 *
 *   const entryUrl = pathToFileURL(join(packageDir, entry)).href;
 *   return await import(entryUrl);
 *
 * are adjacent in the source and stay adjacent in the bundle, minified or not.
 * (An earlier revision anchored on the warning string that reports the import's
 * failure. That is ~100 source lines away: adjacent once minified, but thousands
 * of characters away in an unminified `build:prod` bundle, where the guard then
 * failed a perfectly correct build.)
 *
 * With the comment, the bundled call site reads:
 *   …pathToFileURL(join(dir,entry)).href; return await import(t)
 * Without it, the same call site reads:
 *   …pathToFileURL(join(dir,entry)).href; return await l(5252)(t)
 * — a numbered webpack context module. The assertions below are exactly that
 * difference: at least one `pathToFileURL` in the bundle must be followed by a
 * native `import(<identifier>)`, and none may be followed by a context-module
 * call. (Other packages in the bundle call `pathToFileURL` without importing
 * anything; those windows simply match neither pattern.)
