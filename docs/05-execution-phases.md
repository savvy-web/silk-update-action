# Execution phases

The action runs as three phases — `pre`, `main` and `post` — declared in its `action.yml` under `runs:`. The pre phase provisions the GitHub App token, the main phase does the dependency-update work and the post phase reports duration and revokes the token. This document walks through each phase in order.

## Pre phase

The pre phase provisions the GitHub App installation token before any updates run.

- Reads the `app-client-id` and `app-private-key` inputs and mints an installation token for the App
- Runs a fail-fast permission check against the scopes the action needs (`contents: write`, `pull-requests: write` and `checks: write`). A missing scope fails the run here, in the pre phase, rather than partway through the main phase
- Records a start time so the post phase can report total duration
- Persists the token to cross-phase state so the main phase can read it back

## Main phase

The main phase reads the token the pre phase provisioned and runs the dependency-update workflow. The steps below run in order, and steps tied to an absent input are skipped.

### Parse inputs

- Parses and validates all action inputs. An input that is present but malformed fails the run here, naming the input; an absent input takes its documented default
- Validates the enumerated inputs against their accepted values — `upgrade-package-manager` and each `upgrade-runtime-*` against their keywords or a parseable semver range, `runtime-data` against `offline` and `live`. An unrecognized value fails rather than falling back
- Validates that at least one update type is active — `config-dependencies`, `dependencies`, a non-`false` `upgrade-package-manager`, or an `upgrade-runtime-*` input. All of these default to off, so a workflow that configures none of them fails at this step
- Validates that `peer-lock` and `peer-minor` do not list the same package
- Warns if a `peer-lock` or `peer-minor` entry does not match any `dependencies` pattern
- Creates a GitHub check run for status visibility in the UI

### Detect the package manager

- Resolves the workspace root and its package manager once, before any other step, and records both in the run context log
- Detection reads the lockfile together with the root manifest. A repository that names a manager only in `devEngines.packageManager`, with no matching lockfile, is detected as npm
- pnpm, bun and npm are supported. Yarn is rejected with an input error, as are workspaces with no resolvable root
- Detection runs inside the check run, so an unsupported workspace fails visibly in the GitHub UI rather than exiting early with no status
- Every step below dispatches on this one value, and every file read or written is anchored at the detected workspace root rather than the process working directory — the action can be invoked from a subdirectory

### Branch management

- Validates that the `source-branch` and `target-branch` refs exist, failing fast before any destructive operation
- Creates the update branch from the source branch (`source-branch`, default `main`) when it does not exist, then fetches and checks it out locally
- Force-resets the branch to the source branch when it does exist, in a single ref update rather than a delete followed by a create, so the ref never disappears mid-run
- This reset strategy guarantees the PR always shows only the dependency changes against the current source branch

### Capture lockfile state (before)

- Reads the lockfile the detected package manager writes — `pnpm-lock.yaml` for pnpm, `bun.lock` for bun, `package-lock.json` for npm — and parses all three into one normalized model
- Stores the lockfile in memory for later comparison
- A missing lockfile is logged and skipped rather than failing the run

### Upgrade the package manager

- Runs when the `upgrade-package-manager` input is non-`false`. The default is `false`, so this step is skipped unless the workflow opts in
- Applies to the package manager detected for the workspace — pnpm, bun or npm — not to pnpm specifically
- Detects the current version from `devEngines.packageManager` in `package.json`, falling back to the `packageManager` field
- Checks for the latest available version of that manager within range. An explicit range typed for a different manager satisfies nothing and is skipped with a warning naming the mismatch
- Updates the `packageManager` and `devEngines` fields when a newer version is available, written as a bare version (a `devEngines` range operator is kept), and strips any existing `+<integrity>` suffix even when the version is already current
- Records the version change for the PR summary and commit message; it does not create a changeset, but it does trigger the lockfile regeneration step, whose install runs under the newly provisioned version

### Upgrade runtimes

- Runs when any of `upgrade-runtime-node`, `upgrade-runtime-deno` or `upgrade-runtime-bun` is set to `auto` or a semver range
- Resolves the latest version for the matching `devEngines.runtime` entry and rewrites its `version` to the bare exact version, dropping any range operator
- Upgrades only an entry the manifest already declares; a runtime with no entry is skipped with a warning, in every mode
- Uses the `runtime-data` source — `offline` reads the bundled cache, `live` fetches the latest data and falls back to the cache on failure
- Resolution covers only currently-maintained major lines; a request targeting an end-of-life line is skipped with a warning
- Like a package-manager self-upgrade, a runtime bump appears in the PR summary and commit message but never creates a changeset; unlike a package-manager self-upgrade, it never triggers the install step

### Update config dependencies

- Iterates over each config dependency listed in the `config-dependencies` input
- Resolves each config dependency within a conservative range derived from its current major (these entries are hash-pinned and carry no explicit range)
- Where the resolved version is written dispatches on the detected package manager:
  - **pnpm** — edits the `configDependencies` entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in place. Editing in place avoids `pnpm add --config`, which would promote the dependency into a catalog
  - **bun** — bun has no config-dependency mechanism, so the workflow is reproduced against catalogs: the config dependency's published `catalogs` export is three-way merged into the root `package.json` `catalog` and `catalogs` fields, using the version recorded in the lockfile as the merge base so a hand-written override is distinguishable from an entry a previous run wrote. The per-entry outcomes (added, updated, removed, kept) reach the PR body as a Catalog Changes table. Names owned by this path are excluded from the workspace-dependency step so one manifest entry is not bumped twice
  - **npm** — skipped with a warning. npm implements no `catalog:` protocol, so there is nothing to merge into
- Honors the workspace's pnpm release-age gate (`minimumReleaseAge`): candidate versions published inside the age window are held back, logged and picked up on a later run once they mature (see [Release-age gating](./02-configuration.md#release-age-gating))
- Uses error accumulation: if one dependency fails to update, the others still proceed, and failures are logged as warnings

### Update workspace dependencies

- Iterates over each dependency pattern in the `dependencies` input
- Matches against `dependencies`, `devDependencies` and `optionalDependencies` in every workspace `package.json` (`peerDependencies` are excluded — those are managed by `peer-lock` and `peer-minor`)
- A dependency listed in multiple sections of one `package.json` is updated in each section independently and produces one update record per section
- Resolves each dependency within the semver range already declared in `package.json` rather than jumping to npm's absolute latest — a `^4.0.0` specifier stays on `4.x`, a `~3.0.0` stays on `3.0.x`, a wider range like `>=4.0.0` may advance across a major, and an exact pin is left untouched; querying the npm registry directly this way also avoids `pnpm up --latest` promoting dependencies into catalogs when `catalogMode: strict` is enabled
- Supports glob patterns such as `@savvy-web/*`
- Honors the workspace's pnpm release-age gate the same way the config-dependency step does
- Uses error accumulation: individual failures do not block other updates

### Sync peer dependencies

- For each workspace dependency update matching a `peer-lock` or `peer-minor` entry, finds the corresponding `peerDependencies` range, computes the new range and writes the updated `package.json`
- `peer-lock` syncs the peer range on every version bump
- `peer-minor` syncs the peer range only on minor or major bumps and floors the patch to `.0`
- Preserves the existing prefix (`^`, `~`, `>=` and so on)
- Skips with a warning when no peer entry exists for the package

### Regenerate lockfile and install

- Runs only when there is a package-manager upgrade, config-dependency update, workspace-dependency update or peer-sync rewrite to process; otherwise the step logs that there is nothing to install
- The command dispatches on the detected package manager, and every command runs at the detected workspace root rather than the process working directory:
  - **pnpm** — `pnpm clean --lockfile` removes `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `node_modules` (requires pnpm 11+; a `clean` or `purge` script in the root `package.json` runs in place of the built-in), then `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false` regenerates the lockfile. `--frozen-lockfile=false` opts out of CI's default refusal to write lockfile changes
  - **bun** — `bun install --force`, which re-resolves every dependency against the registry instead of replaying the lockfile
  - **npm** — `package-lock.json` is unlinked through Node rather than a shelled `rm` (which does not exist on a Windows runner), then `npm install` re-resolves. npm has no clean-and-resolve mode of its own: `npm ci` requires the lockfile to already be correct
- The lockfile is regenerated rather than repaired because the action mutates all three inputs to resolution — the package manager version, its config, and the declared ranges — and a repair-only install never re-runs resolution under the changed inputs, so it can commit an inconsistent lockfile
- Advancing transitive versions within their declared ranges is expected, so a larger lockfile diff is intentional rather than noise
- When the package manager was upgraded, this install runs under the new version, which the activation step provisioned (verifying the pnpm or npm tarball against the registry integrity) and put ahead on `PATH`

### Format pnpm-workspace.yaml

- Runs for pnpm workspaces only. Under bun and npm there is no `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to format, and the step is skipped with a logged reason naming the detected manager
- Reads and parses `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- Sorts array values alphabetically (`packages`, `onlyBuiltDependencies`, `publicHoistPattern`)
- Sorts top-level keys alphabetically with `packages` kept first
- Writes back with consistent formatting (2-space indent, no line wrapping, double quotes) so lint-staged does not change the file after commit

### Run custom commands

- Executes commands from the `run` input sequentially via `sh -c`
- Attempts all commands regardless of individual failures
- If any command fails, updates the check run with a failure conclusion, includes the failure details in the summary, exits without creating a PR or committing, and outputs `has-changes: false` and `updates-count: 0`

### Capture lockfile state (after)

- Re-reads the same lockfile after all dependency changes, using the detected package manager's lockfile name
- Stores the updated lockfile for comparison

### Detect changes

Change detection uses two complementary methods.

Lockfile comparison diffs the before and after lockfiles. Catalog comparison detects shared version updates (`catalog:default`, `catalog:silk` and so on) and scans importers to find which packages use each changed catalog entry. Importer comparison detects direct, non-catalog dependency version changes per package.

A `git status --porcelain` check detects any modified, staged or untracked files. If both the lockfile comparison and git status show no changes, the action exits early with a neutral check-run conclusion.

### Create changesets

- Skips entirely if the `changesets` input is `false`
- Checks whether a `.changeset/` directory exists
- Recomputes the cumulative dependency diff between the base branch (`merge-base`) and the working tree, so the checkout must include full history (`fetch-depth: 0`); a shallow checkout cannot resolve the merge-base
- For each affected workspace package, applies two conditions. The package's diff must contain at least one consumer-facing change — a `dependency`, `optionalDependency` or `peerDependency` change, including peer-sync rewrites; `devDependency`-only changes never produce a changeset. The package must also be versionable — publishable, or a private package opted in via `privatePackages.version` in `.changeset/config.json` — and not listed in the changeset `ignore` list
- When both conditions hold, writes a single consolidated `patch` changeset whose `## Dependencies` table lists the package's `dependency`, `optionalDependency` and `peerDependency` changes (dev rows are dropped)
- Regeneration is convergent: stale pure-dependency changesets it supersedes are deleted, so re-running the action produces one current table per package rather than accumulating duplicates. Hand-authored changesets that mix a `## Dependencies` table with prose are left untouched
- Empty changesets are not written, and config-only changes do not produce a changeset

### Commit and push

Commits are created through the GitHub Git Data API rather than a local `git commit`.

- Collects the changed files from git status
- Builds a tree of blob entries from their contents
- Creates a commit with a conventional commit message and no explicit author, which is what lets GitHub attribute the commit to the App and sign it
- Adds a DCO `Signed-off-by` trailer to the commit message, because a commit created through the API bypasses `git commit -s` and nothing else would add one. The trailer names the authenticated App's bot identity (`<your-app>[bot]`), matching the account the commit is attributed to; when the installation token cannot be read it falls back to `github-actions[bot]`
- Updates the branch ref to the new commit, then fetches and checks out the updated branch locally

In dry-run mode this step is skipped entirely.

### Create or update PR

- Searches for an existing open PR from the update branch to the target branch (`target-branch`, which defaults to following `source-branch`)
- Updates the title and body of an existing PR, or creates a new one
- The PR body includes per-package tables with dependency, type, action, from and to columns, plus changeset details in expandable sections
- The body also carries a proposed squash-commit block, whose `Signed-off-by` trailer is the same one the commit above carries, so a reviewer comparing the two does not find two different authors
- If `auto-merge` is set, enables auto-merge on the PR via the GitHub GraphQL API; failures are logged as warnings without failing the action
- Sets the `pr-number`, `pr-url`, `updates-count` and `has-changes` outputs
- Writes a GitHub Actions job summary with the same information

In dry-run mode this step is skipped and a PR body preview is included in the job summary instead.

## Post phase

The post phase runs after the main phase, even when the main phase fails.

- Reports the total run duration from the start time the pre phase recorded
- Revokes the installation token so it is not left live after the run
- Guards revocation so a failure here never fails the workflow
