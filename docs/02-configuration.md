## Inputs

### Required inputs

#### `app-client-id`

The client ID of your GitHub App. Found on the GitHub App settings page. This is the App's client ID, not its numeric App ID.

#### `app-private-key`

The private key for your GitHub App in PEM format. Generate this from the GitHub
App settings page and store it as a repository secret.

### Optional inputs

#### `config-dependencies`

Config dependencies to update, one per line. These correspond to entries in your
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` `configDependencies` section. Each line must be an exact
package name (no glob patterns).

```yaml
config-dependencies: |
  typescript
  @biomejs/biome
```

#### `dependencies`

Workspace dependencies to update, one per line. Matches against the
`dependencies`, `devDependencies` and `optionalDependencies` fields in all
workspace `package.json` files. Supports glob patterns.

```yaml
dependencies: |
  vitest
  @savvy-web/*
```

`peerDependencies` are intentionally not matched here — peer ranges are
managed by the [`peer-lock`](#peer-lock) and [`peer-minor`](#peer-minor) inputs
instead.

If a package lists the same dependency in multiple sections (for example, both
`dependencies` and `devDependencies`), each section is updated independently
and reported as a separate row in the PR summary.

At least one of `config-dependencies`, `dependencies`, a non-`false`
`upgrade-package-manager`, or an `upgrade-runtime-*` input must be active.

#### `peer-lock`

Package names whose `peerDependencies` range syncs on every version bump (patch
and minor). Must be explicit package names (no globs). Each package must also
match a `dependencies` pattern.

```yaml
peer-lock: |
  vitest-agent-reporter
```

When `vitest-agent-reporter` updates from `1.0.0` to `1.0.3`, the peer range
updates from `^1.0.0` to `^1.0.3`. The existing prefix (`^`, `~`, `>=`, etc.)
is preserved.

#### `peer-minor`

Package names whose `peerDependencies` range syncs only on minor or major
version bumps. Patch-only bumps leave the peer range unchanged. Must be explicit
package names (no globs). Each package must also match a `dependencies` pattern.

```yaml
peer-minor: |
  vitest
  @vitest/coverage-v8
```

When `vitest` updates from `3.1.0` to `3.2.5`, the peer range updates to
`^3.2.0` (patch floored to `.0`). When `vitest` updates from `3.1.0` to
`3.1.2`, the peer range stays at `^3.1.0`.

**Validation:**

- A package cannot appear in both `peer-lock` and `peer-minor` (the action
  fails with an error)
- If a `peer-lock` or `peer-minor` entry does not match any `dependencies`
  pattern, a warning is logged

#### `branch`

The branch name used for the dependency update PR. Default: `pnpm/config-deps`.

The action creates this branch from the source branch if it does not exist, or resets it to the source branch before applying updates (see [`source-branch`](#source-branch)).

```yaml
branch: deps/weekly-update
```

#### `source-branch`

The branch the update branch is created from and reset to on each run. Default: `main`. The pull request also targets this branch unless [`target-branch`](#target-branch) overrides it. Both refs are validated before the destructive branch reset — a missing ref fails the run early.

```yaml
source-branch: dev
```

#### `target-branch`

The branch the pull request merges into. Default: empty, which follows `source-branch`. Set it only to target a different branch than the one the update was cut from — for example, cut from `dev` but merge into `main`. When changesets are enabled, this branch is also the baseline for the changeset diff.

```yaml
source-branch: dev
target-branch: main
```

#### `run`

Shell commands to run after dependency updates, one per line. All commands are
executed sequentially. If any command fails, the action stops and does not create
a PR.

```yaml
run: |
  pnpm lint:fix
  pnpm test
  pnpm build
```

#### `upgrade-package-manager`

Upgrades the package manager **detected for this workspace** — pnpm, bun or npm
— declared in the `packageManager` and `devEngines.packageManager` fields of the
root `package.json`. Values: `false` (skip), `true`/`auto` (latest within the
current major, favoring the `devEngines` version), or a semver range (e.g. `^11`,
which may cross majors and adds a `packageManager` field when none exists). The
version change is tracked as a config dependency update. Default: `true`.

pnpm and npm are managed by corepack, so their resolved version is written
hash-pinned (`pnpm@11.0.0+sha512.<hex>`). corepack does not manage bun, so bun is
written as a bare version.

An explicit range is resolved against the **detected** package manager's release
list. A range typed for a different manager (a pnpm-shaped `^11` in a bun repo)
satisfies nothing and is skipped with a warning naming the mismatch.

A package-manager bump also triggers the lockfile regeneration step, whose install
performs the corepack switch to the new version (pnpm, npm).

```yaml
upgrade-package-manager: false # Disable automatic package-manager upgrades
```

#### `upgrade-runtime-node`

Upgrade the Node.js entry in `devEngines.runtime`. Three modes:

- `false` (default) — skip; Node.js runtime is not touched
- `auto` — resolve the latest version within the existing entry's range and
  re-decorate with its operator; no-op if the entry is a static exact pin, if
  no entry exists, or if the resolved version already matches the current value;
  never adds a missing entry
- A semver range (e.g. `^22`) — resolve the latest version satisfying the given
  range, then write it back **preserving the existing entry's operator** (an
  exact pin like `24.11.0` stays exact, a caret stays caret) regardless of the
  operator in the range you pass — the range only selects which line to move to.
  Adds a new entry if one is missing, using the range's own operator in that case

```yaml
upgrade-runtime-node: auto
```

> **EOL note:** Version resolution only covers currently-maintained (non
> end-of-life) major lines. If the existing entry or an explicit range targets
> an EOL line (e.g. `^20` after Node 20 reaches EOL), resolution fails and the
> runtime bump is skipped with a warning. This applies to both offline and live
> data sources.

#### `upgrade-runtime-deno`

Upgrade the Deno entry in `devEngines.runtime`. Accepts the same values as
`upgrade-runtime-node` (`false`, `auto`, or a semver range such as `^2`).
Default: `false`.

```yaml
upgrade-runtime-deno: auto
```

#### `upgrade-runtime-bun`

Upgrade the Bun entry in `devEngines.runtime`. Accepts the same values as
`upgrade-runtime-node` (`false`, `auto`, or a semver range such as `^1`).
Default: `false`.

```yaml
upgrade-runtime-bun: ^1
```

#### `runtime-data`

Data source used by the runtime version resolver. Default: `offline`.

- `offline` — use only the bundled runtime version cache; no network access
  or authentication required
- `live` — fetch the latest runtime data from the network, falling back to the
  bundled cache on failure

```yaml
runtime-data: live
```

**Example — auto-upgrade Node.js and Deno using the existing ranges:**

If your root `package.json` contains:

```json
{
  "devEngines": {
    "runtime": [
      { "name": "node", "version": "^24.0.0", "onFail": "ignore" },
      { "name": "deno", "version": "^2.0.0", "onFail": "ignore" }
    ]
  }
}
```

With this configuration:

```yaml
upgrade-runtime-node: auto
upgrade-runtime-deno: auto
```

The action resolves the latest Node.js `^24` and Deno `^2` versions (within
maintained lines) and rewrites the `version` fields to e.g. `^24.16.0` and
`^2.1.0`, preserving the `^` operator and the `onFail` field. The bump is
included in the PR summary and commit message. It does not trigger a changeset
and does not run `pnpm install`.

#### `changesets`

When set to `true` and a `.changeset/` directory exists, the action regenerates
a consolidated dependency changeset for each affected package after the updates.
Set to `false` to skip changeset creation entirely, which is useful for
repositories that do not use the changeset release workflow. Default: `true`.

```yaml
changesets: false # Skip changeset creation
```

The changeset step diffs the working tree against the base branch, so the
checkout must include full history. Set `fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout`
when changesets are enabled — a shallow checkout cannot resolve the merge-base
and the changeset content will be wrong or empty.

#### `dry-run`

When set to `true`, the action detects changes and reports them in the GitHub
Actions summary but does not commit, push or create a PR. Useful for testing
configuration. Default: `false`.

#### `auto-merge`

Enables GitHub's auto-merge on the dependency update PR after it is created.
Accepted values are `merge`, `squash` and `rebase`, matching the merge
strategy. Leave empty (the default) to disable auto-merge.

**Prerequisites:**

- The repository must have "Allow auto-merge" enabled in **Settings > General**
- Branch protection rules with required status checks must be configured on the
  base branch

If auto-merge cannot be enabled (e.g. missing prerequisites), the action logs a
warning and continues — it does not fail the workflow.

```yaml
auto-merge: squash # Enable auto-merge with squash strategy
```

## Outputs

### `pr-number`

The pull request number, if a PR was created or updated. Empty if no PR was
created (no changes detected, or dry-run mode).

### `pr-url`

The pull request URL. Empty if no PR was created.

### `updates-count`

The number of dependencies that were updated (string).

### `has-changes`

Whether any dependency changes were detected (`"true"` or `"false"`).

### Using outputs

```yaml
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v4
  id: update-deps
  with:
    app-client-id: ${{ vars.APP_CLIENT_ID }}
    app-private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    config-dependencies: |
      typescript

- name: Comment on PR
  if: steps.update-deps.outputs.has-changes == 'true'
  run: |
    echo "PR created: ${{ steps.update-deps.outputs.pr-url }}"
    echo "Updates: ${{ steps.update-deps.outputs.updates-count }}"
```

## Authentication

The action authenticates as a GitHub App, and the token's lifecycle spans the three phases. The pre phase exchanges the App credentials for a short-lived installation token. The main phase uses that token for every GitHub API call. The post phase revokes it.

The token is masked in workflow logs, so it does not appear in build output even when a step echoes its environment.

## Dependency selection

### Config dependencies

[Config dependencies](https://pnpm.io/config-dependencies) are declared in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` and provide workspace-level tooling. They are hash-pinned
with no explicit range, so the action upgrades each one within a conservative
range derived from its current major. A config dependency at `>=1.0.0` stays
within its current major; one below `1.0.0` may advance across the `0.x` line
and adopt the first stable major (`1.x`), but never crosses two majors at once.
The action edits the `configDependencies` entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in
place, which avoids the catalog promotion that `pnpm add --config` would
introduce.

```yaml
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
configDependencies:
  typescript: 5.4.0
  "@biomejs/biome": 1.6.1
```

### Workspace dependencies

Workspace dependencies are matched against the `dependencies`,
`devDependencies` and `optionalDependencies` fields in all `package.json`
files. `peerDependencies` are intentionally excluded — peer ranges are
managed by the `peer-lock` and `peer-minor` inputs.

The action resolves each dependency within the semver range already declared in
`package.json`, rather than jumping to npm's absolute latest. A `^4.0.0`
specifier resolves to the highest `4.x` and will not cross to `5.x`; a `~3.0.0`
specifier stays within `3.0.x`; a wider range like `>=4.0.0` may advance across
a major. An exact pin (e.g. `4.0.0`, no operator) is a single-version range and
is left untouched. A caret on a pre-1.0 version is the one exception to plain
caret semantics: `^0.5.2` rolls forward across the `0.x` line and adopts the
first stable `1.x` (resolving within `>=0.5.2 <2.0.0`) rather than being trapped
in `0.5.x` by npm's caret-on-zero rule, mirroring how config dependencies advance
out of `0.x`. A tilde on a pre-1.0 version is unaffected. Prereleases are excluded. Querying the npm registry directly
this way also avoids `pnpm up --latest`, which promotes deps to catalogs when
`catalogMode: strict` is enabled. Glob patterns follow Node's `path.matchesGlob`:

| Pattern | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `vitest` | Exact package `vitest` |
| `@effect/*` | All packages in the `@effect` scope |
| `@savvy-web/*` | All packages in the `@savvy-web` scope |

### Peer dependency syncing

Peer dependency ranges can be automatically synced when the corresponding
workspace dependency updates. This is controlled by the `peer-lock` and
`peer-minor` inputs.

Published packages list peer dependencies to declare compatibility. When you update a dependency like `vitest`, the peer range should reflect the version you tested against. A `devDependency` change alone does not warrant a release, since dev dependencies are stripped from published packages — but a peer range change is consumer-facing and produces a patch changeset.

**Strategies:**

| Strategy | Behavior | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `peer-lock` | Sync on every bump | `1.0.0` to `1.0.3` updates peer to `^1.0.3` |
| `peer-minor` | Sync on minor+ only | `3.1.0` to `3.1.2` leaves peer at `^3.1.0`; `3.1.0` to `3.2.0` updates to `^3.2.0` |

Version resolution follows semver naturally. If the workspace dependency
specifier is `^3.1.0`, the action resolves the highest version satisfying that
range — the highest `3.x`, never crossing into `4.x`. The peer range then syncs
to the resolved version per the chosen strategy.

## Post-update commands

Commands specified in the `run` input execute after all dependency updates and
`pnpm install`. Use them to fix formatting, run tests or rebuild.

- Commands run sequentially in the order listed
- All commands are attempted even if earlier ones fail
- If any command fails, the action reports the failure, updates the check run with an error status and exits without creating a PR
- Commands are executed via `sh -c`, so shell features are available

## Branch management

The action manages a dedicated branch for dependency updates:

1. The `source-branch` and `target-branch` refs are validated up front — a missing ref fails the run before any destructive operation
2. If the branch does not exist, it is created from the source branch (`source-branch`, default `main`)
3. If the branch exists, it is deleted and recreated from the source branch to ensure a clean state
4. Changes are committed via the GitHub API (not `git commit`) to produce verified/signed commits
5. The branch ref is updated directly using the Git Data API

This approach ensures the PR always shows a clean diff against the source branch with only the dependency changes.

## Changeset integration

If your repository has a `.changeset/` directory and the `changesets` input is
`true` (the default), the action regenerates a consolidated dependency changeset
for each affected package. Rather than appending a new changeset every run, it
recomputes the cumulative dependency diff between the base branch and the working
tree, writes a single current `## Dependencies` table per package and deletes any
stale pure-dependency changesets it supersedes. Re-running the action therefore
converges on one table per package instead of piling up duplicates. Hand-authored
changesets that mix a `## Dependencies` table with prose are left untouched.

Because the diff is taken against the base branch, the checkout must include full
history — set `fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout` (see
[Getting started](./01-getting-started.md)). A shallow checkout cannot resolve
the merge-base.

A workspace package gets a `patch` changeset only when **both** conditions hold:

1. **Consumer-facing changes** — the package's dependency diff must contain at least one `dependency`, `optionalDependency` or `peerDependency` change (peer ranges synced by `peer-lock` or `peer-minor` count).

   `devDependency`-only changes never produce a changeset, and dev rows are dropped from the changeset table (dev dependencies are stripped from published packages).

   `devEngines.runtime` upgrades (from `upgrade-runtime-*`) and package-manager self-upgrades (from `upgrade-package-manager`) are tooling-level changes that appear in the PR summary and commit message but never create a changeset.

2. **Versionable** — the package must be publishable (non-private, or with a `publishConfig` targeting a registry) or a private package opted in via `privatePackages.version` in `.changeset/config.json`, and must not be listed in the changeset `ignore` list.

   Packages that are not versionable are skipped silently.

Changeset tables list the package's `dependency`, `optionalDependency` and `peerDependency` changes. Empty changesets are not written; config-only updates (`pnpm-workspace.yaml` `configDependencies`) do not produce a changeset.

## Advanced patterns

### Separate config and regular updates

Run the action twice in the same workflow with different branches:

```yaml
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v4
  with:
    app-client-id: ${{ vars.APP_CLIENT_ID }}
    app-private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    branch: deps/config
    config-dependencies: |
      typescript
      @biomejs/biome

- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v4
  with:
    app-client-id: ${{ vars.APP_CLIENT_ID }}
    app-private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    branch: deps/regular
    dependencies: |
      effect
      @effect/*
```

### Auto-merge with squash

Automatically merge the dependency PR once status checks pass:

```yaml
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v4
  with:
    app-client-id: ${{ vars.APP_CLIENT_ID }}
    app-private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    config-dependencies: |
      typescript
    auto-merge: squash
```

### Conditional updates

Use outputs to gate subsequent steps:

```yaml
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v4
  id: deps
  with:
    app-client-id: ${{ vars.APP_CLIENT_ID }}
    app-private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    dependencies: |
      effect

- name: Notify Slack
  if: steps.deps.outputs.has-changes == 'true'
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v2
  with:
    payload: |
      {"text": "Dependency PR created: ${{ steps.deps.outputs.pr-url }}"}
```
