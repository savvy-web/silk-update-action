## 1.1.1

### Bug Fixes

* [`0626369`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/0626369652e3cd1865793cc87e473a4d40dc5fc0) Stops the action from creating an empty commit and opening a spurious pull request when a `run` command leaves the working tree dirty only by an executable-bit change (for example, husky chmod-ing `.husky` hook scripts during `savvy-commit init`).

- Change detection now runs `git status` with `core.fileMode=false`, so file-mode-only changes are ignored and no longer bypass the no-changes early exit
- This matches what the action actually commits — file content via the GitHub API at mode `100644` — so a mode-only diff can no longer produce an empty commit

## 1.1.0

### Features

* [`3eff0ab`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/3eff0abe855961357470ca61a82a02195adba95a) ### devEngines Runtime Upgrade

Adds optional automatic upgrading of `devEngines.runtime` entries (`node`, `deno`, `bun`) in the root `package.json` via a new `RuntimeUpgrade` service backed by the `runtime-resolver` package.

Four new action inputs control the feature:

| Input                  | Default   | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `upgrade-runtime-node` | `false`   | `false` disables; `auto` bumps within the existing range preserving the operator; a semver range (e.g. `^22`) selects which line to resolve but preserves the existing entry's operator on write (an exact pin stays exact), using the range's own operator only when adding a missing entry |
| `upgrade-runtime-deno` | `false`   | Same semantics as `upgrade-runtime-node`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `upgrade-runtime-bun`  | `false`   | Same semantics as `upgrade-runtime-node`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `runtime-data`         | `offline` | `offline` uses the bundled release cache only; `live` fetches current data with fallback to the bundled cache                                                                                                                                                                                |

Resolution is limited to currently-maintained (non-end-of-life) major lines. `auto` mode is a no-op when the field is a static pin or already current. Runtime bumps appear in the PR body, commit message, and Actions summary but never trigger `pnpm install` and never create a changeset — consistent with how pnpm tooling upgrades are handled.

**Example — bump Node.js within its existing range:**

```yaml
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v1
  with:
    upgrade-runtime-node: auto
```

**Example — move Node.js to a specific major line with live data:**

```yaml
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v1
  with:
    upgrade-runtime-node: "^22"
    runtime-data: live
```

## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* [`1410542`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/1410542223c745e1ddadf03927d562552beb17f4) The `app-id` input has been renamed to `app-client-id`. Update your workflow's `with:` block when upgrading.

### Features

* [`1410542`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/1410542223c745e1ddadf03927d562552beb17f4) Migrate to `@savvy-web/github-action-effects` 2.0 and `workspaces-effect` 1.0, adopting a three-phase (pre/main/post) GitHub App token lifecycle. The installation token is provisioned in a pre step — with up-front verification that the App grants `contents`, `pull-requests`, and `checks` write — and revoked in a post step via the `GitHubToken` namespace, replacing the previous in-process token bridge. A new optional `skip-token-revoke` input skips revocation in the post step (tokens expire after 1 hour regardless).

Adopt `@savvy-web/silk-effects` for publishability detection, replacing the action's local copy of the silk rules. Changeset creation now honors `.changeset/config.json` `ignore`: a package listed there is never given a changeset, even when `privatePackages.version` is enabled.

## 0.12.1

### Bug Fixes

* [`66ebacd`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/66ebacd92c126eb454b45f26a7d5dada28955933) ### Match dependencies across all writable sections

The `dependencies` input now matches against `dependencies`,
`devDependencies`, and `optionalDependencies` of each workspace
package's `package.json`. Previously, only `devDependencies` were
scanned, so deps declared in `dependencies` (e.g. a runtime dep of a
publishable package) or `optionalDependencies` were silently skipped
even when they matched a configured pattern.

`peerDependencies` remain intentionally excluded — peer ranges are
managed by the `peer-lock` and `peer-minor` inputs via `syncPeers`.

A dependency that appears in more than one section of the same
package (e.g. both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`) is now
updated in every section it appears in, with one update record per
section.

### Refactoring

* [`66ebacd`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/66ebacd92c126eb454b45f26a7d5dada28955933) Removed the local `Workspaces` service wrapper now that
  `workspaces-effect@0.5.1` exposes `WorkspaceDiscovery.listPackages(cwd)`
  and `WorkspaceDiscovery.importerMap(cwd)` upstream. Domain services
  yield `WorkspaceDiscovery` directly; `makeAppLayer` wires
  `WorkspaceDiscoveryLive` and `WorkspaceRootLive` with `NodeContext.layer`.
  No user-facing API changes.

### Accurate dependency type reporting

`DependencyUpdateResult.type` now reflects the actual section a dep
was found in (`dependency` / `devDependency` / `optionalDependency`)
instead of always reporting `devDependency`. `Changesets.create`
routes these by `update.type`: `dependency` and `optionalDependency`
trigger changeset emission for the affected workspace package, and
`devDependency` remains informational only. Catalog-resolved peer
changes and peer-sync rewrites continue to trigger as before.

## 0.12.0

### Features

* [`d06ac37`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/d06ac37f48542eb67b8de34082419ffdbeb8eb5c) ### Versionable + trigger-driven changeset emission

Changesets now follow precise rules:

* A workspace package gets a changeset only if it is **versionable** (publishable per silk or vanilla mode rules, OR non-publishable with `privatePackages.version: true` in `.changeset/config.json`).
* A versionable package gets a changeset only when at least one **trigger** fires for it: a `dependencies` / `optionalDependencies` / `peerDependencies` specifier change in its own `package.json`, a peer-sync rewrite of one of its peers, or a non-dev catalog reference resolving to a different version after the run.
* `devDependencies`-only changes never produce a changeset (they appear in the table only when a changeset is being written for other reasons).
* Empty changesets are no longer emitted.

### Bug Fixes

* [`d06ac37`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/d06ac37f48542eb67b8de34082419ffdbeb8eb5c) ### Catalog consumer detection on pnpm v9 lockfiles

`findCatalogConsumers` in the lockfile service now reads catalog specifiers from the importer's flat `specifiers` map (the pnpm v9 lockfile shape) instead of incorrectly looking for a `.specifier` property on the per-dep value (which is just a version string). Previously, catalog changes never surfaced as triggers because consumers were never matched. Catalog reference changes consumed in `dependencies`, `optionalDependencies`, or `peerDependencies` now correctly trigger changesets for the consuming workspace.

* [`ef5b742`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/ef5b7420ca76d66232a1f910622983acfe9cfd41) ### Root-package name resolution

The action now correctly resolves the root workspace package's name when emitting changesets. Previously, dependency changes affecting the root would produce a changeset with the literal frontmatter key `"."` instead of the root's actual `name` field from `package.json`. The root cause was the underlying `workspace-tools` dependency excluding the root package from its package list; replaced with `workspaces-effect` which always includes the root.

* [`cadb1df`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/cadb1dfc766d0112a611ddd80f2766f8ef1e3080) ### Preserve transitive dependencies during install

The action's lockfile-refresh step previously deleted `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` before running `pnpm install`, forcing a from-scratch resolve. This had the side effect of bumping transitive dependencies for packages the action was not asked to touch — every run could quietly move unrelated transitives forward to whatever the registry currently resolved them to.

* [`ef5b742`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/ef5b7420ca76d66232a1f910622983acfe9cfd41) Replace `workspace-tools` with `workspaces-effect` for workspace discovery and package metadata, via a new `Workspaces` domain service in `src/services/`.
* Add integration test infrastructure under `__test__/integration/` with two committed mock-workspace fixtures (`single-package-private-root` and `multi-package-public-root`).

The step now runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false --fix-lockfile` instead. The new command reconciles the lockfile against the just-modified `package.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` files and installs `node_modules` to match, touching only the directly-bumped specifiers and their strict transitives. Unrelated transitives stay at their currently-pinned versions.

The `--frozen-lockfile=false` flag is required because pnpm auto-enables `--frozen-lockfile` in CI (`CI=true` is always set in GitHub Actions), which would otherwise refuse to write the lockfile changes the action just made.

### Maintenance

* [`ef5b742`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/ef5b7420ca76d66232a1f910622983acfe9cfd41) Replace `workspace-tools` with `workspaces-effect` for workspace discovery and package metadata, via a new `Workspaces` domain service in `src/services/`.
* Add integration test infrastructure under `__test__/integration/` with two committed mock-workspace fixtures (`single-package-private-root` and `multi-package-public-root`).

### Per-importer per-section catalog change records

`compareCatalogs` now emits one `LockfileChange` per `(catalog change, consuming importer, dep section)` triple instead of a single aggregated record. Each record carries the accurate `type` field, so changes consumed only in `devDependencies` no longer incorrectly produce changesets for those workspaces.

When a clean install resolves a newer version within the same semver range (e.g., `^2.8.4` stays unchanged but resolves `2.8.6` to `2.8.7`), the action now correctly detects and reports the change. Previously, `compareCatalogs()` only compared the `specifier` field of catalog entries, ignoring the `version` (resolved) field. This caused changes that stayed within the declared semver range to fall through both the catalog and importer comparison paths undetected, resulting in 0 reported changes and an empty PR body.

The fix compares both `specifier` and `version` fields of `ResolvedCatalogEntry`. When only the resolved version changed, the reported from/to values use the concrete resolved versions (e.g., `2.8.6` to `2.8.7`). When the specifier itself changed, existing behavior is preserved (e.g., `^2.8.4` to `^2.9.0`).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

* 85f1c06: Add `changesets` input option (default: `true`) to control whether changesets are created during dependency updates. When set to `false`, the action skips changeset creation, which is useful for repos that don't need the release cycle and just want a dependency update PR.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

* 127b7b6: Add auto-merge support for dependency update PRs. A new `auto-merge` input
  accepts `merge`, `squash`, or `rebase` to enable GitHub's auto-merge via the
  GraphQL API after PR creation. Failures are handled gracefully with a warning
  log, requiring repository-level "Allow auto-merge" and branch protection to
  be configured.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

* eec6269: Add pnpm self-upgrade step that detects pnpm versions from `packageManager` and `devEngines.packageManager` fields in root `package.json`, resolves the latest version within the `^` semver range, and upgrades via `corepack use`. Controlled by the new `update-pnpm` input (default: `true`). The upgrade runs before config dependency updates and is reported alongside them in the PR body.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

* 826309a: Initial release of the Silk Update Action.

  A GitHub Action that automates updates to pnpm config dependencies and regular
  dependencies, filling the gap left by Dependabot's lack of support for pnpm's
  `configDependencies` feature in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

  ### Features

  * **Config dependency updates**: Updates config dependencies via `pnpm add --config`,
    tracking version changes with before/after comparison
  * **Regular dependency updates**: Updates regular dependencies via `pnpm up --latest`
    with glob pattern support (e.g., `effect`, `@effect/*`, `@savvy-web/*`)
  * **Custom post-update commands**: Execute commands after dependency updates via the
    `run` input (e.g., `pnpm lint:fix`, `pnpm test`). All commands run sequentially;
    if any fail, the job fails and no PR is created
  * **Changeset integration**: Automatically creates patch changesets for affected
    packages, with empty changesets for root workspace config dependency updates
  * **Verified commits**: Creates signed/verified commits via the GitHub API using
    GitHub App authentication (no SSH or GPG keys required)
  * **Branch management**: Manages a dedicated update branch with automatic creation
    or reset to the default branch on each run
  * **Lockfile diffing**: Compares `pnpm-lock.yaml` snapshots before and after updates
    to detect actual dependency changes, including catalog entry tracing to identify
    affected workspace packages
  * **Detailed PR summaries**: Generates Dependabot-style PR descriptions with
    dependency tables, npm links, and per-package changeset details
  * **GitHub App authentication**: Uses short-lived installation tokens with
    fine-grained permissions for secure automation
  * **Check run integration**: Creates GitHub check runs for visibility into action
    progress and results
  * **Dry-run mode**: Detect changes without committing, pushing, or creating PRs
  * **Debug logging**: Configurable log levels for troubleshooting

  ### Architecture

  Built with Effect-TS for typed error handling, retry logic, and service-based
  dependency injection. Uses a three-phase execution model (pre/main/post) with
  13 orchestration steps in the main phase.
