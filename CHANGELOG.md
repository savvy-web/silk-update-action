# silk-update-action

## 4.1.1

### Bug Fixes

* Stopped the action from rewriting scoped `pnpm-workspace.yaml` keys (e.g. `"@parcel/watcher"`) from double to single quotes on every run. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` formatting now quotes with double quotes, matching the quoting style already used elsewhere in the file, so re-running the action against an already-formatted workspace file no longer produces a spurious quote-style diff.

### Patch Changes

[#199]: https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/pull/199

## 4.1.0

### Maintenance

* Migrate the action to Effect v4 (`effect@4.0.0-beta.98`) and the `@effected` app kit. The action's inputs and outputs are unchanged.

  ### Effect v4 and the @effected kit

  * `effect` and `@effect/platform-node` now resolve from the `catalog:effect` v4 catalog; the separate `@effect/platform` dependency is dropped (it is folded into core in v4).
  * The standalone Effect libraries are replaced by their `@effected` equivalents: `semver-effect` becomes `@effected/semver`, `workspaces-effect` becomes `@effected/workspaces` (with `@effected/lockfiles` for lockfile parsing), `runtime-resolver` becomes `@effected/runtimes`, and `yaml` becomes `@effected/yaml`.
  * Domain services move to the v4 class-based `Context.Service` form and the v4 error, layer and schema APIs.

  ### Package-manager detection

  Detection is now stricter: a bun or pnpm repository is identified from its lockfile together with the manifest, not from `devEngines.packageManager` alone (the same rule already applied to yarn). A repository that names a package manager only in `devEngines` and has no lockfile is now treated as npm.

  ### Test harness

  The Vitest config temporarily runs without `@vitest-agent/plugin`, which is Effect v3-only and crashes Vitest at config load under v4; the same coverage gate is preserved. Restore the plugin once it ships a v4-compatible release. [#194][#194]

### Patch Changes

## 4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* The `upgrade-runtime-node`, `upgrade-runtime-deno` and `upgrade-runtime-bun` inputs no longer add a `devEngines.runtime` entry that does not already exist. Previously an explicit semver range could introduce a missing entry (promoting the object shape to an array), so a bun-only repo passing `upgrade-runtime-node` grew a node entry it never asked for. These inputs upgrade the runtimes a repo already declares; when no entry exists for the runtime, the upgrade is skipped with a warning naming the runtime and the input, in every mode.

  Resolved runtime versions are now written as exact versions with no range operator. The range still drives resolution — `auto` resolves within the existing entry's range and an explicit input range selects which line to resolve — but the value written is always the bare resolved version, so an existing `^24.0.0` entry is rewritten as e.g. `24.9.1` rather than `^24.16.0`. Range operators are not supported by downstream consumers of `devEngines.runtime` (silk-runtime-action), so writing one was a latent failure in the next pipeline step.

  The package-manager upgrade now emits a warning, not an info line, when no release of the detected package manager satisfies the `upgrade-package-manager` range — the usual cause is a range typed for a different package manager than the workspace uses. [#186][#186]

- **`config-dependencies` means something different per package manager.** pnpm reads `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; bun merges the package's `catalogs` export into `package.json`. In an **npm** repo it is unsupported and skipped with a warning: npm does not implement the `catalog:` protocol (bun and yarn do; the npm CLI does not).

- **`upgrade-runtime-*` upgrades only, and never adds.** With no existing `devEngines.runtime` entry for a runtime, there is nothing to upgrade and the input is skipped with a warning — in every mode. Previously an explicit semver range would *add* a missing entry, which grew an unwanted `node` entry in a bun-only repo.

- **Runtime versions are always written exact.** The range now only selects which line to resolve; the value written is the bare resolved version with no operator, so an existing `^24.0.0` is rewritten as e.g. `24.9.1`. Operator preservation was dropped deliberately: `silk-runtime-action`, which consumes `devEngines.runtime` in the next pipeline step, does not support range operators, so any operator written here is a latent downstream failure.

- **Two lockfile-diff reporting changes on the pnpm path.** A dependency declared in both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` now emits one change record per section rather than one in total, and a `peerDependencies` specifier change is now typed `peerDependency` (it was previously mislabelled `dependency`). Both are corrections, but they move `updates-count` and the generated PR title for existing pnpm consumers.

- Yarn repos are rejected with a clear error instead of being treated as pnpm.

* Remove the `log-level` and `skip-token-revoke` inputs. Logging now has two modes only — normal, or debug when the runner's step-debug flag (`ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` / `RUNNER_DEBUG`) is enabled — matching what the previous `auto` default already did. The post phase now always revokes the GitHub App installation token, which was the default behavior. Workflows passing either input will see an unexpected-input warning: remove the lines, and rely on re-running with debug logging where `log-level: debug` was used before. [#186][#186]

### Features

* The action is now package-manager-dispatched. One detected fact — the package manager — selects the implementation at four points: config dependencies, install, the package-manager upgrade, and the lockfile diff. pnpm, bun and npm repos are all supported. The package manager is detected from `devEngines.packageManager`, falling back to lockfile and config-file presence. Yarn is detected and rejected with a clear error rather than being silently treated as something else.

  * **Config dependencies in bun repos.** pnpm reads config dependencies from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. bun has no such concept, so a package listed in `config-dependencies` is instead located in the root manifest's dependencies, its module is fetched and executed, and its `catalogs` export is merged into the root `package.json`'s `catalog` / `catalogs` fields. The tarball is verified against the registry's integrity before it is executed.

    Merging is **three-way** against the version that was previously installed, because — unlike pnpm, which merges catalogs in memory at install time and never rewrites the manifest — compat mode must write the result to disk, and a later run cannot otherwise tell a deliberate user override from an entry the action itself wrote. Entries the manifest still agrees with the previous version on are the action's to update; entries that diverge are the user's and survive, even if upstream dropped them; upstream removals propagate.

  * **`upgrade-package-manager` upgrades bun and npm**, not just pnpm. Corepack-managed managers (pnpm, npm) keep the pinned `+sha512` hash; bun is written as a bare version, because corepack does not manage bun and never reads that field.

  * **The install step is package-manager aware**: pnpm regenerates the lockfile (`pnpm clean --lockfile` then `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false`), bun re-resolves against the registry (`bun install --force`), npm removes `package-lock.json` and installs. The rationale is unchanged — the action mutates every input to dependency resolution, so the lockfile is regenerated rather than repaired.

  * **The lockfile diff is package-manager agnostic.** It reads `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock` and `package-lock.json` through one parser, so it works in every supported repo instead of silently capturing nothing outside pnpm. The pnpm-only `@pnpm/lockfile.fs` and `@pnpm/lockfile.types` dependencies are gone.

  * **Catalog changes are reported.** On a config-dependency bump the PR body and job summary now render the table of catalog ranges that actually moved. Without it a bun run reported "1 config dependency updated" and showed none of what changed.

  * **Logging names every step and every decision.** The old step numbering had drifted out of sync with the steps. Steps are now named, every dispatch point states which path it took and on what evidence, and no step is skipped without saying so and why.

### Bug Fixes

* Bun catalogs are written at the **top level** of `package.json` (`catalog` / `catalogs` as siblings of `workspaces`) rather than nested inside the `workspaces` object. Both shapes are valid and bun reads either, so the nested form was not broken — but writing it rewrote an author's `"workspaces": ["."]` array into an object form they never wrote. A manifest already carrying the nested form is read and migrated on the next write, so it self-heals.

* A misconfigured `upgrade-package-manager` range now **warns**. A range that no release of the detected package manager satisfies (for example a pnpm range left behind in a bun repo) was reported at the same level as a routine skip, so it scrolled past as ordinary output.

* `pnpm-workspace.yaml` formatting is skipped in non-pnpm repos, where there is no such file to format. [#186][#186]

## 3.4.5

### Bug Fixes

* The changeset step no longer silently writes zero changesets when dependency updates were applied earlier in the same run. The bundled `workspaces-effect` and `@savvy-web/silk-effects` now refresh the workspace-discovery cache before `DepsRegen` snapshots the worktree, so the diff sees the just-updated manifests instead of the ones cached before the update steps ran.

### Documentation

* Corrected the README and `docs/` guide to describe the `source-branch` / `target-branch` inputs and the `pnpm clean --lockfile` regeneration step, which were previously documented as always resetting to `main` and reconciling via `--fix-lockfile` [#168][#168]

## 3.4.3

### Features

* PR and commit subject lines now break down dependency updates by `package.json` section instead of lumping them together — for example `chore(deps): update 1 config dependency and 4 devDependencies` instead of `chore(deps): update 1 config and 4 dependencies` — so it's clear at a glance whether an update touched runtime, dev, or peer dependencies. [#163][#163]

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed the pnpm self-upgrade silently skipping with a warning on GitHub's macOS runners. Resolving available pnpm versions now goes through the action's npm registry client (which redirects npm's cache to a runner-writable directory) instead of shelling out to `npm view`, which failed with `EACCES` against the partially root-owned `~/.npm` cache.

* [`64967fe`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/64967fe0b9d3018ad82730f0624c7ba8daccfe15) Adopt `@savvy-web/silk-effects` `Changesets.DepsRegen` as the source of truth for the dependency-changeset step. Dependency changesets are now regenerated from the cumulative `merge-base(target-branch) → worktree` diff and consolidated into a single `## Dependencies` table per package, deleting stale pure-dependency changesets — so re-running the action converges instead of accumulating duplicate changesets. Catalog-aware diffing and versionable-minus-ignored gating are handled upstream in silk-effects; the previous in-repo gating cascade and the `changeset-config`/`publishability` shims are removed.
* Workflows that enable `changesets` now need a full-history checkout (`actions/checkout` with `fetch-depth: 0`): the changeset step diffs against the base branch via `git merge-base`. `BranchManager.ensureBaseHistory` best-effort deepens a shallow clone when the base history is missing.

Each run produces a specific, readable subject that reflects what changed.

Examples of generated titles:

* `chore(deps): upgrade pnpm to 10.12.1`
* `chore(deps): upgrade Node to 24.16.0`
* `chore(deps): bump effect to 3.19.1`
* `chore(deps): upgrade pnpm and update 6 dependencies`
* `chore(deps): update 3 config and 12 dependencies`

Single changes are named outright; single-category runs are summarized; mixed runs compose an `upgrade … and update …` shape. All subjects keep the `chore(deps):` conventional-commit prefix and stay within the 72-character header budget (falling back to `chore(deps): update dependencies` when a composed subject would overflow).

* [`a09bff1`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/a09bff17389ebe2a6aa5c459f4441780b4a03364) Two new optional inputs let you control which branches the action operates against. With both unset, behavior is unchanged — the update branch is cut from `main` and the PR targets `main`.

### Bug Fixes

* [`a09bff1`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/a09bff17389ebe2a6aa5c459f4441780b4a03364) `runInstall()` — the lockfile-reconciliation step that runs after pnpm, config dependency, runtime, and regular/peer range updates — now fully regenerates the lockfile instead of patching it. It runs `pnpm clean --lockfile` followed by `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false`, replacing the previous `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false --fix-lockfile`.

`--fix-lockfile` only repaired broken entries against the existing lockfile and did not re-run resolution under the changed pnpm version, config, and dependency ranges. This could commit an internally inconsistent `pnpm-lock.yaml` — most visibly when an upstream peer range changed (for example, a transitive raising its required `@effect/cluster` peer) and the new required peer was left unfilled, causing a downstream command to fail with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

Regenerating the lockfile from scratch guarantees the committed `pnpm-lock.yaml` is correct and installable for the resolved pnpm version, config dependencies, and declared ranges.

* Expect larger `pnpm-lock.yaml` diffs in update PRs than before. Because the action obeys declared ranges, lockfile regeneration will advance transitive dependencies within their ranges. This is intentional — the previous behavior was silently suppressing those advancements.
* Requires pnpm 11+ for `pnpm clean`. If your root `package.json` defines a `clean` or `purge` script, pnpm will run that instead of the built-in lockfile cleanup; rename those scripts if they conflict.

### `source-branch` and `target-branch` inputs

`source-branch` (default `main`) is the branch the dedicated dependency-update branch is created from and reset to on each run. The pull request targets this branch unless `target-branch` overrides it.

`target-branch` (default empty) is the branch the pull request merges into. Leave it unset to follow `source-branch`; set it only when you want to cut the update from one branch but merge the PR into a different one.

```yaml
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v3
  with:
    # Cut the update branch from dev, PR into main
    source-branch: dev
    target-branch: main
```

Both refs are validated before the action performs its destructive delete-and-recreate of the update branch. If either ref does not exist, the action fails fast with a clear input error rather than mid-run.

* [`c5e91bb`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/c5e91bb737016f06b5067da87edc71f82ad9e7fd) ### Caret-on-zero regular deps roll forward to the first stable major

Regular dependencies declared with a caret on a pre-1.0 version (`^0.y.z`) now
resolve within a widened range (`>=0.y.z <2.0.0`) instead of the literal caret
range (`0.y.x`). This lets a pre-stable dependency advance across `0.x` minor
lines and adopt the first stable `1.x` release when one is available, rather
than being trapped by npm's caret-on-zero semantics.

All other specifier forms are unchanged: tilde (`~0.y.z`), exact pins (`0.y.z`),
comparator ranges (`>=0.y.z`), and caret deps on `>=1.0.0` versions continue to
resolve within the literal specifier.

```yaml
# package.json (before)
"some-lib": "^0.14.0" # was trapped in 0.14.x

# package.json (after a run with some-lib@1.2.0 published)
"some-lib": "^1.2.0" # advanced to latest stable major
```

* [`f59107d`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/f59107da57e11bad2b071eca5c6bd434c991303f) ### Version selection now respects declared semver ranges

Previously, both regular and config dependency updates resolved to npm's absolute `latest` tag, ignoring the specifier declared in `package.json` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. This caused caret- and tilde-pinned deps to silently cross major boundaries — for example, a `^4.0.0` entry could be bumped to `5.x`.

Version selection now honors the existing specifier:

* **Regular dependencies** (`dependencies` input): resolves the highest published version satisfying the existing `package.json` specifier. A `^4.0.0` entry stays within `4.x`, a `~3.0.0` entry stays within `3.0.x`, and an exact pin (e.g. `4.0.0`) is left untouched. Prereleases are excluded. An unbounded range such as `>=4.0.0` may still advance across majors, matching its declared intent.

* **Config dependencies** (`config-dependencies` input, hash-pinned entries in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`): resolves within a conservative range derived from the current version's major. A `>=1.0.0` dep stays within its major; a pre-stable dep (`0.x`) may advance to the first stable major but never crosses two majors in one step.

The pnpm self-upgrade input has been renamed from `update-pnpm` to `upgrade-package-manager` for consistency with the `upgrade-runtime-*` inputs. The old name is no longer recognized — consumers must rename the input in their workflow files.

```yaml
# Before
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v3
  with:
    update-pnpm: true

# After
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v3
  with:
    upgrade-package-manager: true
```

The input accepts `false` | `true` | `auto` | a semver range (default `true`). It currently upgrades pnpm only; support for other package managers is planned.

### Features

* [`acbe9c7`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/acbe9c797f33592f0b90c5a7464c8d7db89669bd) ### Direct-edit pnpm upgrade with hash pinning and range support

`PnpmUpgrade` now edits the root `package.json` `packageManager` and `devEngines.packageManager` fields directly instead of running `corepack use` (which errors when both fields are present). The resolved version is written as a corepack-canonical `version+sha512.<hex>` hash derived from the npm registry integrity, so the committed fields are identical to what `corepack use` would produce.

The input also accepts explicit semver ranges (e.g. `^11`) that may cross majors and can add a `packageManager` field when none exists. `true`/`auto` resolve the latest within the current major, favoring the `devEngines.packageManager` version as the reference. The pnpm upgrade now triggers `pnpm install --fix-lockfile` to activate the new version via corepack reading the updated fields.

### Maintenance

* [`acbe9c7`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/acbe9c797f33592f0b90c5a7464c8d7db89669bd) Action and package renamed from `pnpm-config-dependency-action` to `silk-update-action` to align with the Silk Suite. Update `uses:` references accordingly:

* [`0626369`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/0626369652e3cd1865793cc87e473a4d40dc5fc0) Stops the action from creating an empty commit and opening a spurious pull request when a `run` command leaves the working tree dirty only by an executable-bit change (for example, husky chmod-ing `.husky` hook scripts during `savvy-commit init`).

- Change detection now runs `git status` with `core.fileMode=false`, so file-mode-only changes are ignored and no longer bypass the no-changes early exit
- This matches what the action actually commits — file content via the GitHub API at mode `100644` — so a mode-only diff can no longer produce an empty commit

### Features

* [`3eff0ab`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/3eff0abe855961357470ca61a82a02195adba95a) ### devEngines Runtime Upgrade

Adds optional automatic upgrading of `devEngines.runtime` entries (`node`, `deno`, `bun`) in the root `package.json` via a new `RuntimeUpgrade` service backed by the `runtime-resolver` package.

Four new action inputs control the feature:

| Input                  | Default   | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `upgrade-runtime-node` | `false`   | `false` disables; `auto` bumps within the existing range preserving the operator; a semver range (e.g. `^22`) selects which line to resolve but preserves the existing entry's operator on write (an exact pin stays exact), using the range's own operator only when adding a missing entry |
| `upgrade-runtime-deno` | `false`   | Same semantics as `upgrade-runtime-node`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `upgrade-runtime-bun`  | `false`   | Same semantics as `upgrade-runtime-node`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `runtime-data`         | `offline` | `offline` uses the bundled release cache only; `live` fetches current data with fallback to the bundled cache                                                                                                                                                                                |

Resolution is limited to currently-maintained (non-end-of-life) major lines. `auto` mode is a no-op when the field is a static pin or already current. Runtime bumps appear in the PR body, commit message, and Actions summary but never trigger `pnpm install` and never create a changeset — consistent with how pnpm tooling upgrades are handled.

**Example — bump Node.js within its existing range:**

```yaml
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v3
  with:
    upgrade-runtime-node: auto
```

**Example — move Node.js to a specific major line with live data:**

```yaml
- uses: savvy-web/silk-update-action@v3
  with:
    upgrade-runtime-node: "^22"
    runtime-data: live
```

### Breaking Changes

* [`1410542`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/1410542223c745e1ddadf03927d562552beb17f4) The `app-id` input has been renamed to `app-client-id`. Update your workflow's `with:` block when upgrading.

### Features

* [`1410542`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/1410542223c745e1ddadf03927d562552beb17f4) Migrate to `@savvy-web/github-action-effects` 2.0 and `workspaces-effect` 1.0, adopting a three-phase (pre/main/post) GitHub App token lifecycle. The installation token is provisioned in a pre step — with up-front verification that the App grants `contents`, `pull-requests`, and `checks` write — and revoked in a post step via the `GitHubToken` namespace, replacing the previous in-process token bridge. A new optional `skip-token-revoke` input skips revocation in the post step (tokens expire after 1 hour regardless).

Adopt `@savvy-web/silk-effects` for publishability detection, replacing the action's local copy of the silk rules. Changeset creation now honors `.changeset/config.json` `ignore`: a package listed there is never given a changeset, even when `privatePackages.version` is enabled.

## 0.12.1

### Bug Fixes

* [`66ebacd`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/66ebacd92c126eb454b45f26a7d5dada28955933) ### Match dependencies across all writable sections

The `dependencies` input now matches against `dependencies`,
`devDependencies`, and `optionalDependencies` of each workspace
package's `package.json`. Previously, only `devDependencies` were
scanned, so deps declared in `dependencies` (e.g. a runtime dep of a
publishable package) or `optionalDependencies` were silently skipped
even when they matched a configured pattern.

`peerDependencies` remain intentionally excluded — peer ranges are
managed by the `peer-lock` and `peer-minor` inputs via `syncPeers`.

A dependency that appears in more than one section of the same
package (e.g. both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`) is now
updated in every section it appears in, with one update record per
section.

### Refactoring

* [`66ebacd`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/66ebacd92c126eb454b45f26a7d5dada28955933) Removed the local `Workspaces` service wrapper now that
  `workspaces-effect@0.5.1` exposes `WorkspaceDiscovery.listPackages(cwd)`
  and `WorkspaceDiscovery.importerMap(cwd)` upstream. Domain services
  yield `WorkspaceDiscovery` directly; `makeAppLayer` wires
  `WorkspaceDiscoveryLive` and `WorkspaceRootLive` with `NodeContext.layer`.
  No user-facing API changes.

### Accurate dependency type reporting

`DependencyUpdateResult.type` now reflects the actual section a dep
was found in (`dependency` / `devDependency` / `optionalDependency`)
instead of always reporting `devDependency`. `Changesets.create`
routes these by `update.type`: `dependency` and `optionalDependency`
trigger changeset emission for the affected workspace package, and
`devDependency` remains informational only. Catalog-resolved peer
changes and peer-sync rewrites continue to trigger as before.

* [`d06ac37`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/d06ac37f48542eb67b8de34082419ffdbeb8eb5c) ### Versionable + trigger-driven changeset emission

Changesets now follow precise rules:

* A workspace package gets a changeset only if it is **versionable** (publishable per silk or vanilla mode rules, OR non-publishable with `privatePackages.version: true` in `.changeset/config.json`).
* A versionable package gets a changeset only when at least one **trigger** fires for it: a `dependencies` / `optionalDependencies` / `peerDependencies` specifier change in its own `package.json`, a peer-sync rewrite of one of its peers, or a non-dev catalog reference resolving to a different version after the run.
* `devDependencies`-only changes never produce a changeset (they appear in the table only when a changeset is being written for other reasons).
* Empty changesets are no longer emitted.

### Bug Fixes

* [`d06ac37`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/d06ac37f48542eb67b8de34082419ffdbeb8eb5c) ### Catalog consumer detection on pnpm v9 lockfiles

`findCatalogConsumers` in the lockfile service now reads catalog specifiers from the importer's flat `specifiers` map (the pnpm v9 lockfile shape) instead of incorrectly looking for a `.specifier` property on the per-dep value (which is just a version string). Previously, catalog changes never surfaced as triggers because consumers were never matched. Catalog reference changes consumed in `dependencies`, `optionalDependencies`, or `peerDependencies` now correctly trigger changesets for the consuming workspace.

* [`ef5b742`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/ef5b7420ca76d66232a1f910622983acfe9cfd41) ### Root-package name resolution

The action now correctly resolves the root workspace package's name when emitting changesets. Previously, dependency changes affecting the root would produce a changeset with the literal frontmatter key `"."` instead of the root's actual `name` field from `package.json`. The root cause was the underlying `workspace-tools` dependency excluding the root package from its package list; replaced with `workspaces-effect` which always includes the root.

* [`cadb1df`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/cadb1dfc766d0112a611ddd80f2766f8ef1e3080) ### Preserve transitive dependencies during install

The action's lockfile-refresh step previously deleted `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` before running `pnpm install`, forcing a from-scratch resolve. This had the side effect of bumping transitive dependencies for packages the action was not asked to touch — every run could quietly move unrelated transitives forward to whatever the registry currently resolved them to.

* [`ef5b742`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/ef5b7420ca76d66232a1f910622983acfe9cfd41) Replace `workspace-tools` with `workspaces-effect` for workspace discovery and package metadata, via a new `Workspaces` domain service in `src/services/`.
* Add integration test infrastructure under `__test__/integration/` with two committed mock-workspace fixtures (`single-package-private-root` and `multi-package-public-root`).

The step now runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false --fix-lockfile` instead. The new command reconciles the lockfile against the just-modified `package.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` files and installs `node_modules` to match, touching only the directly-bumped specifiers and their strict transitives. Unrelated transitives stay at their currently-pinned versions.

The `--frozen-lockfile=false` flag is required because pnpm auto-enables `--frozen-lockfile` in CI (`CI=true` is always set in GitHub Actions), which would otherwise refuse to write the lockfile changes the action just made.

### Maintenance

* [`ef5b742`](https://github.com/savvy-web/silk-update-action/commit/ef5b7420ca76d66232a1f910622983acfe9cfd41) Replace `workspace-tools` with `workspaces-effect` for workspace discovery and package metadata, via a new `Workspaces` domain service in `src/services/`.
* Add integration test infrastructure under `__test__/integration/` with two committed mock-workspace fixtures (`single-package-private-root` and `multi-package-public-root`).

### Per-importer per-section catalog change records

`compareCatalogs` now emits one `LockfileChange` per `(catalog change, consuming importer, dep section)` triple instead of a single aggregated record. Each record carries the accurate `type` field, so changes consumed only in `devDependencies` no longer incorrectly produce changesets for those workspaces.

When a clean install resolves a newer version within the same semver range (e.g., `^2.8.4` stays unchanged but resolves `2.8.6` to `2.8.7`), the action now correctly detects and reports the change. Previously, `compareCatalogs()` only compared the `specifier` field of catalog entries, ignoring the `version` (resolved) field. This caused changes that stayed within the declared semver range to fall through both the catalog and importer comparison paths undetected, resulting in 0 reported changes and an empty PR body.

The fix compares both `specifier` and `version` fields of `ResolvedCatalogEntry`. When only the resolved version changed, the reported from/to values use the concrete resolved versions (e.g., `2.8.6` to `2.8.7`). When the specifier itself changed, existing behavior is preserved (e.g., `^2.8.4` to `^2.9.0`).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

* 85f1c06: Add `changesets` input option (default: `true`) to control whether changesets are created during dependency updates. When set to `false`, the action skips changeset creation, which is useful for repos that don't need the release cycle and just want a dependency update PR.

  log, requiring repository-level "Allow auto-merge" and branch protection to
  be configured.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

* eec6269: Add pnpm self-upgrade step that detects pnpm versions from `packageManager` and `devEngines.packageManager` fields in root `package.json`, resolves the latest version within the `^` semver range, and upgrades via `corepack use`. Controlled by the new `update-pnpm` input (default: `true`). The upgrade runs before config dependency updates and is reported alongside them in the PR body.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

* 826309a: Initial release of the Silk Update Action.

  A GitHub Action that automates updates to pnpm config dependencies and regular
  dependencies, filling the gap left by Dependabot's lack of support for pnpm's
  `configDependencies` feature in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

  ### Features

  * **Config dependency updates**: Updates config dependencies via `pnpm add --config`,
    tracking version changes with before/after comparison
  * **Regular dependency updates**: Updates regular dependencies via `pnpm up --latest`
    with glob pattern support (e.g., `effect`, `@effect/*`, `@savvy-web/*`)
  * **Custom post-update commands**: Execute commands after dependency updates via the
    `run` input (e.g., `pnpm lint:fix`, `pnpm test`). All commands run sequentially;
    if any fail, the job fails and no PR is created
  * **Changeset integration**: Automatically creates patch changesets for affected
    packages, with empty changesets for root workspace config dependency updates
  * **Verified commits**: Creates signed/verified commits via the GitHub API using
    GitHub App authentication (no SSH or GPG keys required)
  * **Branch management**: Manages a dedicated update branch with automatic creation
    or reset to the default branch on each run
  * **Lockfile diffing**: Compares `pnpm-lock.yaml` snapshots before and after updates
    to detect actual dependency changes, including catalog entry tracing to identify
    affected workspace packages
  * **Detailed PR summaries**: Generates Dependabot-style PR descriptions with
    dependency tables, npm links, and per-package changeset details
  * **GitHub App authentication**: Uses short-lived installation tokens with
    fine-grained permissions for secure automation
  * **Check run integration**: Creates GitHub check runs for visibility into action
    progress and results
  * **Dry-run mode**: Detect changes without committing, pushing, or creating PRs
  * **Debug logging**: Configurable log levels for troubleshooting

  ### Architecture

  Built with Effect-TS for typed error handling, retry logic, and service-based
  dependency injection. Uses a three-phase execution model (pre/main/post) with
  13 orchestration steps in the main phase.
