# Services and Utilities

[Back to index](./_index.md)

## Domain Services (src/services/)

All domain logic is wrapped as Effect services with `Context.Tag` + `Layer`,
or (for stateless concerns) exported as standalone helper functions. Each
service depends on library services from `@savvy-web/github-action-effects`
and/or `workspaces-effect`.

### Workspace discovery (via workspaces-effect)

Domain services consume the upstream `WorkspaceDiscovery` Tag from
`workspaces-effect` directly, via its `listPackages(cwd?)` and
`importerMap(cwd?)` methods (both accept an optional cwd).

The upstream service interface (relevant slice):

```typescript
import { WorkspaceDiscovery } from "workspaces-effect";

// WorkspaceDiscovery exposes (among others):
//   listPackages: (cwd?: string) =>
//     Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<WorkspacePackage>, ...>
//   importerMap: (cwd?: string) =>
//     Effect.Effect<ReadonlyMap<string, WorkspacePackage>, ...>
```

`importerMap` returns a map keyed by importer path relative to the workspace
root (`.` for the root workspace), used by `Lockfile.compare` to translate
importer ids into package names.

`WorkspaceDiscoveryLive` requires `WorkspaceRootLive` and `NodeContext.layer` (FileSystem/Path). Both are wired in `makeAppLayer`; integration tests build their own `discoveryLayer` from `NodeContext.layer` directly.

**Caching:** `WorkspaceDiscoveryLive` caches `listPackages` per root for the layer lifetime, and Effect memoizes layers by object reference, so every consumer wired from the same layer shares one instance — an enumeration cached before `ConfigDeps`/`RegularDeps` edit manifests stays stale for later readers unless refreshed (`refresh()`, added in workspaces-effect 2.0.3). DepsRegen refreshes at plan time (see the `Changesets` service below), so the changeset step is not bitten by this.

### Changeset gating (via @savvy-web/silk-effects DepsRegen)

The dependency-changeset step delegates entirely to silk's `Changesets.DepsRegen` — see the `Changesets` service below. All gating (versionable-minus-ignored: publishable OR `privatePackages.version`, minus the changeset `ignore` list) lives **upstream inside DepsRegen**. The action no longer wraps `ChangesetConfig` or the `PublishabilityDetector` overrides: the former `services/changeset-config.ts` and `services/publishability.ts` re-export shims are deleted, and DepsRegen's batteries-included Layer (`DepsRegenDefault`) provides those services internally.

### src/services/branch.ts - BranchManager

Branch management and commit operations using `GitBranch`, `GitCommit`, and
`CommandRunner` library services.

**Service interface:**

```typescript
export class BranchManager extends Context.Tag("BranchManager")<BranchManager, {
 readonly manage: (branchName: string, defaultBranch?: string) =>
  Effect.Effect<BranchResult, GitBranchError | CommandRunnerError>;
 readonly commitChanges: (message: string, branchName: string) =>
  Effect.Effect<void, GitCommitError | CommandRunnerError>;
 readonly validateBranches: (source: string, target: string) =>
  Effect.Effect<void, GitBranchError | ActionInputError>;
 readonly ensureBaseHistory: (base: string) =>
  Effect.Effect<void, CommandRunnerError>;
}>() {}
```

**Branch Strategy:** Delete-and-recreate instead of rebase. The update branch is
created from (and reset to) the configurable `source-branch` (default `main`,
passed as `manage`'s second argument). When the branch already exists, it is
deleted and recreated from the source branch for a fresh start.

**Pre-flight validation:** `validateBranches(source, target)` yields
`GitBranch.exists` for both refs and fails fast with `ActionInputError`
(`inputName` `"source-branch"` / `"target-branch"`) if either ref is missing
(the target check is skipped when `target === source`). `program.ts` calls it
inside `withCheckRun` **before** `manage`, so a typo'd ref aborts before the
destructive delete-and-recreate.

**Commit via GitHub API:** `commitChanges` reads changed files from
`git status --porcelain` (handling `D`-marked deletions as `{ path, sha: null }`)
and calls `GitCommit.commitFiles(branch, message, fileChanges)` — the library's
single-call wrapper that creates the tree, the commit (without an explicit
author so GitHub verifies it), and updates the branch ref. After committing,
the working tree is synced via `git fetch origin <branch>` + `git reset --hard
origin/<branch>` because `git checkout` would refuse to overwrite the
just-committed working-copy state.

**Base-history preflight:** `ensureBaseHistory(base)` probes
`git merge-base <base> HEAD`; if it resolves (the `fetch-depth: 0` case) it is
a no-op.
Otherwise it best-effort fetches the base ref, unshallows a shallow clone and
materializes a local `base` ref, then warns (non-fatal) if the merge-base is
still missing. `program.ts` calls it before the changeset step because silk's
`DepsRegen` diffs `merge-base(base) → worktree`, which a shallow checkout
cannot resolve.

### src/services/workspace-yaml.ts - WorkspaceYaml

Format `pnpm-workspace.yaml` consistently to avoid lint-staged hook changes.

**Formatting Rules:**

1. Sort arrays alphabetically: `packages`, `onlyBuiltDependencies`, `publicHoistPattern`
2. Sort `configDependencies` object keys alphabetically
3. Sort top-level keys alphabetically, but keep `packages` first
4. YAML stringify: `indent: 2`, `lineWidth: 0`, `singleQuote: false`

**Exported helpers** (used directly by `program.ts` and `ConfigDeps`):

- `formatWorkspaceYaml(workspaceRoot?)` - Read, sort, and write back
- `readWorkspaceYaml(workspaceRoot?)` - Read and parse workspace YAML
- `sortContent(content)` - Sort workspace content
- `STRINGIFY_OPTIONS` - Consistent YAML stringify options

### src/services/pnpm-upgrade.ts - PnpmUpgrade

Upgrade pnpm by editing the `packageManager` and `devEngines.packageManager` fields of the root `package.json` directly — **not** via `corepack use`. `corepack use` errors when both `packageManager` and `devEngines.packageManager` are present, so the service derives corepack's canonical hash itself and writes the fields; the subsequent `runInstall` performs the actual corepack switch. Depends on `NpmRegistry` (not `CommandRunner`): `NpmRegistryLive` routes every npm invocation through a runner-writable cache (`--cache $RUNNER_TEMP/silk-npm-cache`), sidestepping the partially root-owned `~/.npm` on GitHub macOS runners that made a raw `npm view` shell-out fail with EACCES (the pnpm upgrade was skipped with a warning while `ConfigDeps`/`RegularDeps`, already on `NpmRegistry`, succeeded).

**Service interface:**

```typescript
export class PnpmUpgrade extends Context.Tag("PnpmUpgrade")<PnpmUpgrade, {
 readonly upgrade: (mode: string, workspaceRoot?: string) =>
  Effect.Effect<PnpmUpgradeResult | null, FileSystemError>;
}>() {}
```

`mode` is the parsed `upgrade-package-manager` value (`false` | `true` | `auto` | a semver
range). `false` returns `null` (skip).

**Algorithm:**

1. Read root `package.json` and parse the `packageManager` field
   (`pnpm@10.28.2`, `pnpm@^10.28.2+sha512...`) and the `devEngines.packageManager`
   field (name must be `pnpm`).
2. Pick a **reference** version favoring `devEngines.packageManager` over the
   `packageManager` field.
3. Choose a target range: `true`/`auto` use `^reference` (latest within the
   current major; skip with a warning if no reference exists); an explicit
   semver range is used verbatim (may cross majors).
4. Query available versions via `NpmRegistry.getVersions("pnpm")` and resolve via `resolveLatestSatisfying`. Skip if none satisfies or the resolved version equals the reference.
5. Derive the corepack-canonical `+sha512.<hex>` hash from the resolved version's npm registry integrity (`NpmRegistry.getPackageInfo("pnpm", resolved)` → `.integrity` → `corepackHashFromIntegrity`, best-effort with a `catchAll`); fall back to a bare version when integrity is unavailable.
6. Write `packageManager` = `pnpm@<v>+sha512.<hex>` (creating it in range mode
   when no pnpm field exists at all) and, when present,
   `devEngines.packageManager.version` = `<v>+sha512.<hex>`. The pinned hash is
   inherently exact, so no range operator is written. Returns
   `PnpmUpgradeResult` with `from: string | null` and `added: boolean`.

### src/services/config-deps.ts - ConfigDeps

Update config dependencies by querying npm via `NpmRegistry` and editing
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` in place. Avoids `pnpm add --config` catalog promotion.

**Service interface:**

```typescript
export class ConfigDeps extends Context.Tag("ConfigDeps")<ConfigDeps, {
 readonly updateConfigDeps: (deps: ReadonlyArray<string>, workspaceRoot?: string) =>
  Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<DependencyUpdateResult>>;
}>() {}
```

**Algorithm:**

1. Read `pnpm-workspace.yaml` via `readWorkspaceYaml()`
2. For each dep, parse its hash-pinned version, derive a conservative upgrade
   range from the major via `configDepUpgradeRange` (`src/utils/semver.ts`),
   query `NpmRegistry.getVersions`, and resolve the highest in-range version via
   `resolveLatestSatisfying` — config deps carry no declared range, so the range
   is synthesized rather than reading npm's absolute latest
3. Compare current with the resolved version; skip if up-to-date, otherwise fetch
   the integrity for **that** resolved version via `getPackageInfo(dep, resolved)`
4. Write back via `sortContent()` + `stringify()`

The range keeps a `>=1.0.0` dep within its current major; a `<1.0.0` dep may
advance across `0.x` and adopt the first stable major but never crosses two
majors in one step.

### src/services/regular-deps.ts - RegularDeps

Update regular dependencies by querying npm via `NpmRegistry`. Avoids
`pnpm up --latest` which promotes deps to catalogs with `catalogMode: strict`.

**Service interface:**

```typescript
export class RegularDeps extends Context.Tag("RegularDeps")<RegularDeps, {
 readonly updateRegularDeps: (patterns: ReadonlyArray<string>, workspaceRoot?: string) =>
  Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<DependencyUpdateResult>>;
}>() {}
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Queries every published version via `NpmRegistry.getVersions` and resolves the
  highest version **satisfying the current specifier treated as a range** via
  `resolveLatestSatisfying` — it does not read npm's absolute `latest` dist-tag.
  So `^4.0.0` stays within major 4, `~3.0.0` stays within the minor, `>=4.0.0`
  may advance across a major, and an exact pin (a one-version range) never bumps.
  The sole exception is caret-on-zero (`^0.y.z`): it is widened via
  `resolutionRangeForSpecifier` to the config-dep range (`>=version <2.0.0`) so a
  `^0.5.0` dep rolls forward across `0.x` and adopts the first stable `1.x`, with
  the caret still re-applied verbatim on write-back.
- Enumerates workspace `package.json` files via `WorkspaceDiscovery` from
  `workspaces-effect`.
- Uses `matchesPattern` from `src/utils/deps.ts` for glob matching.
- Preserves specifier prefix (`^`, `~`, or exact) from `package.json`, re-applied
  verbatim to the resolved version.
- Skips `catalog:` and `workspace:` specifiers.
- Iterates `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `optionalDependencies`
  via `DEP_SECTIONS` (a typed array of `{ field, type }` records).
  `peerDependencies` are intentionally excluded — peer ranges are managed
  by `syncPeers`, not by direct version bumps. Catalog-resolved deps in
  any section still flow through `compareCatalogs` independently.
- Each match carries its `field` and `type` through the pipeline. Dedup
  is per `(path, field)`, so a dep declared in both `dependencies` and
  `devDependencies` of one package emits two records, each with the
  accurate `type`.
- `updatePackageJson` accepts `Map<DepSectionField, Map<string, string>>`
  so each section is updated independently without cross-pollination.
- `DependencyUpdateResult.type` reflects the actual section (`dependency`
  / `devDependency` / `optionalDependency`).
- Gracefully handles npm query failures per-dependency.

### src/services/peer-sync.ts - PeerSync

Sync peerDependency ranges after devDependency updates based on `peer-lock`
and `peer-minor` input configuration. Uses `semver-effect` for version
parsing. **Has no `Context.Tag` of its own** — exported as standalone
functions and consumed directly from `program.ts`. Yields `WorkspaceDiscovery`
from `workspaces-effect` to resolve package paths.

**Exported functions:**

- `computePeerRange(params)` — Compute new peer range based on strategy
  (returns `Effect<string | null, never>`).
- `syncPeers(config, devUpdates, workspaceRoot?)` — Sync all peer ranges;
  signature is
  `Effect<readonly DependencyUpdateResult[], FileSystemError, WorkspaceDiscovery>`.

**Types:**

- `PeerStrategy` — `"lock" | "minor"`.
- `PeerSyncConfig` — `{ lock: ReadonlyArray<string>; minor: ReadonlyArray<string> }`.

**Strategies:**

- `lock`: Sync peer range on every version bump (patch and minor).
- `minor`: Sync peer range only on minor+ bumps, floor patch to `.0`.

**Algorithm:**

1. Build strategy lookup map from config.
2. Yield `WorkspaceDiscovery` and call `listPackages(workspaceRoot)` to
   resolve package paths.
3. For each devDep update matching a strategy:
   - Read the package.json.
   - Find the peerDependencies entry.
   - Compute new range using `computePeerRange`.
   - Write updated package.json.

### src/services/lockfile.ts - Lockfile

Compare lockfile snapshots before and after updates to detect changes.
Uses `@pnpm/lockfile.fs` and yields `WorkspaceDiscovery` from
`workspaces-effect`.

**Service interface:**

```typescript
export class Lockfile extends Context.Tag("Lockfile")<Lockfile, {
 readonly capture: (workspaceRoot?: string) =>
  Effect.Effect<LockfileObject | null, LockfileError>;
 readonly compare: (before, after, workspaceRoot?) =>
  Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<LockfileChange>, LockfileError, WorkspaceDiscovery>;
}>() {}
```

**Key behavior — `compareCatalogs`:** for each catalog change, the comparator
walks every importer that consumes the catalog entry and emits **one
`LockfileChange` record per (catalog change, consuming importer, dep
section) triple**. Each record carries the precise `type` field
(`dependency` / `devDependency` / `optionalDependency` / `peerDependency`),
so downstream `Changesets` gating can use `type` alone as the trigger
signal. Catalog refs in `devDependencies` are returned with `type:
"devDependency"` and treated by `Changesets` as informational only.

`compareImporters` handles non-catalog specifier changes (including
removals), reading dep section from the `after` snapshot to type each entry.

**Exported helpers** (used by `program.ts` and `Changesets`):

- `captureLockfileState(workspaceRoot?)` - Standalone capture function
- `compareLockfiles(before, after, workspaceRoot?)` - Standalone compare
  function (signature requires `WorkspaceDiscovery` in its environment)
- `groupChangesByPackage(changes)` - Group lockfile changes by affected package

### src/services/changesets.ts - Changesets

A **thin adapter** over silk's `Changesets.DepsRegen` (from
`@savvy-web/silk-effects`), which is the source of truth for dependency
changesets. Depends only on `SilkChangesets.DepsRegen`. The bespoke changeset
writer and the local gating cascade this file used to carry are gone — see
`src/services/changesets.ts` for the adapter.

**Service interface:**

```typescript
export class Changesets extends Context.Tag("Changesets")<Changesets, {
 readonly create: (
  workspaceRoot: string,
  base: string,
 ) => Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<ChangesetFile>, ChangesetError>;
}>() {}
```

`create(workspaceRoot, base)` calls `depsRegen.plan({ cwd: workspaceRoot, base })`
then `execute(plan)`, and maps `result.written` back to `ChangesetFile[]` for
reporting — reconstructing each `## Dependencies` table via
`SilkChangesets.serializeDependencyTableToMarkdown`. DepsRegen failures
(`GitError`, `WorkspaceDiscoveryError`, `ChangesetIOError`,
`PointInTimeReadError`) are collapsed into the local `ChangesetError` via
`Effect.mapError`. `base` is the resolved `target-branch` (the release
baseline) — the anchor for DepsRegen's `merge-base(base) → worktree` diff.

**Behavior (all upstream in DepsRegen):**

- The adapter short-circuits with an empty result when no `.changeset/`
  directory exists (`hasChangesets` guard).
- Content is DepsRegen's cumulative git diff (`merge-base(base) → worktree`,
  catalog-/workspace-aware). It writes one consolidated dependency changeset
  per in-scope package and deletes stale pure-dependency changesets, so
  re-firing converges to a single current table per package (idempotent).
  devDependency rows are dropped; mixed changesets (Dependencies table +
  prose) are left untouched.
- Gating is silk "versionable-minus-ignored" (publishable OR
  `privatePackages.version`, minus the changeset `ignore` list), applied
  inside DepsRegen. The action no longer re-implements the ignore gate,
  versionable cascade or trigger/informational classification.
- `plan` refreshes workspace discovery before its snapshots and gating reads (silk-effects 3.2.1; workspaces-effect 2.0.3's `worktree()` also refreshes), so the diff sees manifests edited earlier in the same run. Without this the memoized discovery cache served pre-update manifests, the worktree snapshot equaled the merge-base snapshot and the step silently wrote 0 changesets.

**Exported helper:**

- `hasChangesets(workspaceRoot?)` — checks for the existence of
  `.changeset/` (used for early skip / no-op messaging).

### src/services/runtime-upgrade.ts - RuntimeUpgrade

Upgrade `devEngines.runtime` entries (node/deno/bun) in the root `package.json`
via `runtime-resolver`. Depends on `NodeResolver`, `DenoResolver`, and
`BunResolver` Tags from `runtime-resolver`. Mirrors `PnpmUpgrade`; resolver
failures are caught and skipped per-runtime, never fatal.

**Service interface:**

```typescript
export class RuntimeUpgrade extends Context.Tag("RuntimeUpgrade")<
 RuntimeUpgrade,
 {
  readonly upgrade: (
   config: RuntimeUpgradeConfig,
   workspaceRoot?: string,
  ) => Effect.Effect<readonly RuntimeUpgradeResult[], FileSystemError>;
 }
>() {}
```

**Types:**

- `RuntimeName` — `"node" | "deno" | "bun"`.
- `RuntimeUpgradeConfig` — `{ node: string; deno: string; bun: string }` where each field
  is `"false"`, `"auto"`, or an explicit semver range string.
- `RuntimeUpgradeResult` — `{ runtime: RuntimeName; from: string | null; to: string; added: boolean }`.

**Resolution algorithm (per runtime):**

1. If the mode is `"false"`, return `null` (skip).
2. Look up the existing `devEngines.runtime` entry via `findRuntimeEntry`.
3. **`auto` mode:** if no entry exists or it is a static pin (`isStaticVersion`), skip with a
   warning. Otherwise use the existing version string as the target range and its leading
   operator (`parseRuntimeOperator`) as the output operator.
4. **Explicit range mode:** use the user-typed value as the target range. The output operator
   follows the **existing** entry (`parseRuntimeOperator(entry.version)`) so its pattern is
   preserved — an exact pin stays exact, a caret stays caret — even when the input range used a
   different operator. Only when **adding** a brand-new entry (no existing entry) does the output
   operator fall back to the one the user typed in the range.
5. Call `resolver.resolve({ semverRange: targetRange })` and get `latest`. On any error
   (`VersionNotFoundError` or network failure), log a warning and skip.
6. Re-decorate: `operator + latest` via `redecorateVersion`. If `newVersion === from`, skip (already
   current).
7. Call `upsertRuntimeEntry(pkgJson, runtime, newVersion)` to write the new version into the
   package JSON object in memory. Track whether an entry was added vs modified.
8. After processing all runtimes, write back `package.json` (preserving indentation via
   `detectIndent`) only if at least one update succeeded.

**Shape handling (via `upsertRuntimeEntry`):**

- Existing array entry: version is updated in place, all other fields preserved.
- Existing single-object entry: version is updated in place, shape stays as object.
- New entry into existing array: new object appended, mirroring a sibling's `onFail` (or `"ignore"`
  if none).
- New entry when `runtime` field is absent: created as a single-element array.
- New entry when `runtime` field is a single object: promoted to a two-element array.

**EOL note:** `runtime-resolver`'s bundled cache and live API both exclude end-of-life major lines.
A resolution targeting an EOL line returns `VersionNotFoundError` and is skipped with a warning.
This means `auto` on a `^20`-ranged entry (once Node 20 is EOL) will no-op.

### src/services/report.ts - Report

PR management and report generation. Depends on `PullRequest` library
service. Uses `GithubMarkdown` from the library to assemble PR bodies and
summaries.

**Service interface:**

```typescript
export class Report extends Context.Tag("Report")<Report, {
 readonly createOrUpdatePR: (branch, base, updates, changesets, autoMerge?) =>
  Effect.Effect<PullRequestResult, PullRequestError>;
 readonly generatePRBody: (updates, changesets) => string;
 readonly generateSummary: (updates, changesets, pr, dryRun) => string;
 readonly generateCommitMessage: (updates, appSlug?) => string;
}>() {}
```

`base` is the resolved `target-branch` (the PR merge target), threaded in from
`program.ts`. PR creation failures propagate through the Effect error channel as
`PullRequestError` rather than returning a sentinel result.

Both the PR title (`createOrUpdatePR`) and the commit subject (the first line of `generateCommitMessage`) are derived from the run's contents via `buildUpdateSubject(updates)` (`src/utils/commit-subject.ts`) — no static `chore(deps): …` constant. `generateCommitMessage`'s body bullets and `Signed-off-by` footer are unchanged.

## Layer Composition (src/layers/app.ts)

`makeAppLayer(dryRun, { runtimeLive })` wires all library and domain layers.
`dryRun` controls the `DryRun` service; `runtimeLive` (default: `false`) selects
how the `NodeResolver`, `DenoResolver` and `BunResolver` Tags consumed by
`RuntimeUpgradeLive` are built (see `makeRuntimeResolvers` in `src/layers/app.ts`):
the offline path provides resolvers over the bundled `Offline*CacheLive` (no
network or auth), the live path provides them over `Auto*CacheLive` backed by
version fetchers and a `GitHubClientLive` (auth from `GitHubAutoAuth`) that fall
back to the bundled cache on any fetch failure. The `GitHubClient` layer used by
the rest of the action is built from `GitHubToken.client()`, which reads the
installation-token envelope the pre phase persisted to `ActionState` — there is
no bare `GitHubClientLive` and no `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN` bridge. `ActionState`
is provided locally (backed by `NodeContext.layer`'s FileSystem) so the layer is
self-contained, and `Layer.orDie` turns a missing/unreadable token into a fatal
defect, keeping the resulting `githubClient` at `R = never` for the `withCheckRun`
callback.

```typescript
export const makeAppLayer = (
 dryRun: boolean,
 options: { runtimeLive: boolean } = { runtimeLive: false },
) => {
 const actionState = ActionStateLive.pipe(Layer.provide(NodeContext.layer));
 const githubClient = GitHubToken.client().pipe(Layer.provide(actionState), Layer.orDie);

 const ghGraphql = GitHubGraphQLLive.pipe(Layer.provide(githubClient));
 const npmRegistry = NpmRegistryLive.pipe(Layer.provide(CommandRunnerLive));
 const gitBranch = GitBranchLive.pipe(Layer.provide(githubClient));
 const gitCommit = GitCommitLive.pipe(Layer.provide(githubClient));
 const prLayer = PullRequestLive.pipe(Layer.provide(Layer.merge(githubClient, ghGraphql)));

 // Platform layer (FileSystem, Path) for workspaces-effect's WorkspaceDiscovery.
 const platform = NodeContext.layer;
 const workspaceRoot = WorkspaceRootLive.pipe(Layer.provide(platform));
 const workspaceDiscovery = WorkspaceDiscoveryLive.pipe(
  Layer.provide(Layer.merge(workspaceRoot, platform)),
 );

 // DepsRegen (silk-effects) is the source of truth for dependency changesets.
 // DepsRegenDefault is batteries-included — it bundles the point-in-time
 // workspace reader, ConfigInspector, WorkspaceDiscovery, the adaptive
 // PublishabilityDetector and ChangesetConfig internally, so it needs only
 // platform services (FileSystem/Path/CommandExecutor from NodeContext.layer).
 const depsRegen = SilkChangesets.DepsRegenDefault.pipe(Layer.provide(platform));

 const libraryLayers = Layer.mergeAll(
  githubClient, gitBranch, gitCommit,
  CheckRunLive.pipe(Layer.provide(githubClient)),
  prLayer, npmRegistry, CommandRunnerLive, DryRunLive(dryRun),
 );

 // NodeResolver/DenoResolver/BunResolver, built offline (bundled cache) or
 // live (Auto*CacheLive over fetchers + GitHubClientLive). See
 // makeRuntimeResolvers for the live wiring.
 const runtimeResolvers = makeRuntimeResolvers(options.runtimeLive);

 const domainLayers = Layer.mergeAll(
  workspaceDiscovery,
  ChangesetsLive.pipe(Layer.provide(depsRegen)),
  BranchManagerLive.pipe(Layer.provide(Layer.mergeAll(gitBranch, gitCommit, CommandRunnerLive))),
  PnpmUpgradeLive.pipe(Layer.provide(npmRegistry)),
  ConfigDepsLive.pipe(Layer.provide(npmRegistry)),
  RegularDepsLive.pipe(Layer.provide(Layer.merge(npmRegistry, workspaceDiscovery))),
  ReportLive.pipe(Layer.provide(prLayer)),
  RuntimeUpgradeLive.pipe(Layer.provide(runtimeResolvers)),
 );

 return Layer.provideMerge(domainLayers, libraryLayers);
};
```

`WorkspaceDiscoveryLive` and `WorkspaceRootLive` come from
`workspaces-effect`; `NodeContext.layer` (from `@effect/platform-node`)
satisfies their FileSystem/Path requirements. The action still wires
`workspaceDiscovery` directly for `RegularDeps` — the changeset step no longer
consumes it, since `DepsRegenDefault` bundles its own discovery internally.

`Changesets.DepsRegenDefault` (from `@savvy-web/silk-effects`) is
FileSystem-based — it reads `.changeset/config.json`, package manifests and the
git worktree via `@effect/platform` FileSystem/CommandExecutor rather than
`node:fs`, so `makeAppLayer` provides the same `platform` (`NodeContext.layer`)
and nothing else. The former hand-wired `changesetConfig` / `publishabilityDetector`
locals are gone.

## Pure Helpers (src/utils/)

### src/utils/branch.ts

- `resolveTargetBranch(rawTarget, source)` — Resolve the PR target branch. An empty (whitespace-only) `target-branch` input is the sentinel for "follow source-branch" (GitHub Actions input defaults cannot reference another input), so the fallback to `source` is resolved here in code.

### src/utils/commit-subject.ts

- `buildUpdateSubject(updates)` — Derive the full conventional PR title / commit subject (`chore(deps): …`) from the run's `DependencyUpdateResult[]`. First-match-wins over four buckets (pnpm self-upgrade, runtimes, config deps, regular deps): names a single change, summarizes runtime-only or config-only batches, scopes a single-workspace dependency batch and composes mixed runs. The regular-deps bucket is broken down by package.json section (dependencies / devDependencies / peerDependencies / optionalDependencies), counting distinct names per section in production-first order with field-name nouns (`update 1 config dependency and 4 devDependencies`); the elliptical coarse form (`update N config and M dependencies`) is kept when the regular deps are all plain `dependencies`, and the single-workspace variant gets the typed noun when the batch is one section (`update devDependencies in @scope/pkg`, mixed batches keep `update dependencies in <ws>`). The 72-char header budget is a progressive degradation ladder: typed breakdown → coarse phrasing → generic `chore(deps): update dependencies` fallback. Versions are shown clean (range operator and `+sha512` suffix stripped); runtime names are capitalized, pnpm stays lowercase. Consumed by `Report` for both the PR title and the commit subject.

### src/utils/deps.ts

- `parseConfigEntry(entry)` - Parse config dependency entry (version + optional hash)
- `matchesPattern(depName, pattern)` - Glob matching via `path.matchesGlob`
- `parseSpecifier(specifier)` - Parse version specifier; returns `null` for `catalog:`/`workspace:`

### src/utils/input.ts

- `parseMultiValueInput(raw)` — Normalize a multi-value GitHub Action input
  string. Accepts JSON arrays, newline-separated lists (with optional `*`
  bullets and `#` comments), or comma-separated values.

### src/utils/markdown.ts

- `npmUrl(packageName)` - Generate npmjs.com URL for a package
- `cleanVersion(version)` - Strip prefix characters from version string

### src/utils/pnpm.ts

- `parsePnpmVersion(raw, stripPnpmPrefix?)` - Parse version from `packageManager` or `devEngines`
- `formatPnpmVersion(version, hasCaret)` - Format version with optional caret
- `detectIndent(content)` - Detect JSON file indentation (reused by `RegularDeps` and `PeerSync`)
- `corepackHashFromIntegrity(integrity)` - Convert an npm registry integrity (`sha512-<base64>`) to corepack's `packageManager` hash form (`sha512.<hex>`) — the exact string `corepack use` would write. Tolerates a JSON-quoted value; returns `null` when the value is missing or not a sha512 integrity.

### src/utils/runtime.ts

Pure helpers for reading and rewriting `devEngines.runtime` entries. No Effect
service dependencies — mirrors `src/utils/pnpm.ts`.

- `parseRuntimeOperator(raw)` — Extract the leading range operator (`^`, `~`, `>=`, etc.)
  from a version string; returns `""` for a bare version with no operator.
- `isStaticVersion(raw)` — True when `raw` is a static exact version (`X.Y.Z`, optionally with
  prerelease/build) and carries no range operator, wildcard (`x`/`*`), OR-set (`||`), or partial
  form. Used to make `auto` a no-op on pinned versions.
- `redecorateVersion(resolved, operator)` — Re-attach an operator to a resolved exact version
  (e.g. `"^" + "24.16.0"` → `"^24.16.0"`).
- `findRuntimeEntry(devEngines, runtime)` — Find the `devEngines.runtime` entry for `runtime`
  (accepts object or array shape), or `null` if absent.
- `upsertRuntimeEntry(pkgJson, runtime, version)` — Set the version for `runtime` inside
  `pkgJson.devEngines.runtime`, mutating `pkgJson` in place. Handles all shape variants (existing
  array entry, existing single-object entry, new entry into array, promote single-object to array,
  create array when absent). Returns `{ added: boolean }`.

### src/utils/semver.ts

- `resolveLatestSatisfying(versions, range)` - Find the highest stable version satisfying an arbitrary semver range (e.g. `^11`, `>=11`). Used by `RegularDeps` (current specifier as range) and `ConfigDeps` (synthesized range).
- `resolutionRangeForSpecifier(prefix, version)` - Decide the range `RegularDeps` resolves a specifier within: the config-dep range (`configDepUpgradeRange(version)`) for caret-on-zero (`^0.y.z`), the literal `prefix+version` otherwise. Falls back to the literal specifier when no numeric major is present.
- `resolveLatestInRange(versions, current)` - Find highest stable version satisfying `^current` (delegates to `resolveLatestSatisfying`).
- `configDepUpgradeRange(version)` - Synthesize a conservative upgrade range from a hash-pinned config-dep version's major: `>=version <(major+1).0.0` for `>=1.0.0`, `>=version <2.0.0` for `<1.0.0`. Returns `null` for a version with no numeric major. Used by `ConfigDeps`, which has no declared range to read.
