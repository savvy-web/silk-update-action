## GitHub App Authentication

**Benefits over Personal Access Tokens:**

- Short-lived tokens (1 hour max)
- Fine-grained permissions
- No user account dependency
- Audit trail tied to app

**Flow (three-phase, coordinated by the `GitHubToken` namespace):**

1. **pre** — `GitHubToken.provision({ permissions })` reads the `app-client-id`
   / `app-private-key` inputs, signs a JWT, finds the installation, exchanges
   the JWT for an installation token, runs a **fail-fast scope check** against
   the requested permissions, and persists the token envelope to `ActionState`.
2. **main** — `GitHubToken.client()` reads the envelope back from `ActionState`
   and builds the `GitHubClient` layer used by all API calls.
3. **post** — `GitHubToken.dispose()` revokes the token (unless
   `skip-token-revoke` is set). `post` always runs, even when `main` fails.

`ActionState` is backed by the runner's `GITHUB_STATE`, which is process-global
across the three Node processes, so the token survives the `pre` → `main` →
`post` process boundaries. The entire flow is handled by
`@savvy-web/github-action-effects`. No custom auth code exists in this codebase.

```typescript
// pre.ts
const token = yield* GitHubToken.provision({
 permissions: { contents: "write", pull_requests: "write", checks: "write" },
});

// main.ts (via makeAppLayer)
const githubClient = GitHubToken.client().pipe(Layer.provide(actionState), Layer.orDie);

// post.ts
yield* GitHubToken.dispose();
```

## Branch Management

**Strategy:**

- Use dedicated branch (default: `pnpm/config-deps`)
- Create if doesn't exist
- Delete and recreate from main if exists (fresh start each run)

**Why Delete-and-Recreate Instead of Rebase:**

- Simpler logic, no conflict resolution needed
- Always starts from a clean state
- Avoids rebase complexity with force-push
- Appropriate since the branch only contains automated dependency updates

**Implementation uses library services:**

- `GitBranch.exists(branchName)` - Check if branch exists
- `GitBranch.getSha(defaultBranch)` - Get SHA of default branch
- `GitBranch.create(branchName, sha)` - Create branch via GitHub API
- `GitBranch.delete(branchName)` - Delete branch via GitHub API
- `CommandRunner.exec("git", [...])` - Fetch and checkout locally

## Check Runs and Status

**Purpose:**

- Provide visibility in GitHub UI
- Show progress during execution
- Report final status (success/failure/neutral)

**Lifecycle (handled by `CheckRun.withCheckRun()`):**

1. Create check run at start (status: `in_progress`)
2. Callback runs the main logic
3. Use `checkRunService.complete(id, conclusion, output)` to finalize
4. Automatically cleaned up on failure

```typescript
const checkRunService = yield* CheckRun;
yield* checkRunService.withCheckRun("Dependency Updates", headSha, (checkRunId) =>
 Effect.gen(function* () {
  // ... do work ...
  yield* checkRunService.complete(checkRunId, "success", {
   title: "Dependency Updates Complete",
   summary: summaryText,
  });
 }),
);
```

## Pull Request Management

**Strategy:**

- Check if PR already exists for the branch via `GitHubClient.rest()`
- Create new PR if none exists
- Update existing PR description if already exists

**Why Update Instead of Close/Reopen:**

- Preserves review history
- Maintains comment threads
- Shows evolution of changes

**Auto-merge Support:**

The action supports enabling auto-merge via the `auto-merge` input:

- **Values:** `""` (disabled, default), `"merge"`, `"squash"`, or `"rebase"`
- **Implementation:** Uses `AutoMerge.enable(nodeId, mergeMethod)` from the library,
  which calls the GitHub GraphQL `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` mutation
- **Requirements:**
  - Repository must have "Allow auto-merge" setting enabled
  - Target branch must have branch protection with required status checks
  - The GitHub App must have `pull-requests: write` permission
- **Error Handling:** Warnings logged on failure, action does not fail

## Verified Commits via GitHub API

Commits are created via the `GitCommit` library service:

1. `GitCommit.createTree(entries, baseSha)` - Create git tree with changed files
2. `GitCommit.createCommit(message, treeSha, parents)` - Create commit (NO author
   parameter, enabling GitHub to attribute and verify)
3. `GitCommit.updateRef(ref, sha, force)` - Update branch ref to new commit

**Why This Matters:**

- Verified commits show trust and authenticity
- No SSH keys or GPG keys needed
- Works automatically with GitHub App tokens
- Consistent with how GitHub's own bots work (Dependabot, etc.)
