/**
 * Step: upgrade the **detected** package manager (pnpm, bun or npm) in place.
 *
 * Driven by the `upgrade-package-manager` input: `false` (the default — opt-in,
 * matching the `upgrade-runtime-*` inputs), `true`, `auto`, or an explicit
 * semver range.
 *
 * **Failure posture: degrade-to-warning.** A read/write failure is caught here,
 * logged, and folded into an `error`-kind outcome, so the error channel is
 * `never` — truthfully. A package-manager bump is not worth aborting a run whose
 * dependency updates are otherwise fine.
 *
 * **The `unsatisfiable` outcome is the one non-benign skip and logs at warning.**
 * It means nothing in *this* manager's release list satisfies the configured
 * range, which is overwhelmingly a range typed for a different manager (a pnpm
 * `^11.0.0` copy-pasted into a bun repo). It must not scroll past at the same
 * level as "disabled" or "already current".
