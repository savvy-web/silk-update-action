/**
 * Step: check the installed graph for unsatisfied peer dependencies.
 *
 * Runs against the **"after" lockfile snapshot** — the one this run is about to
 * commit — rather than re-reading disk, so the gate answers a question about
 * the artifact the PR actually carries.
 *
 * **Failure posture: degrade-to-warning, gate fails CLOSED.** The error channel
 * is `never`. Two distinct things can go wrong and they are deliberately not
 * treated alike:
 * - The run must never fail because a peer *report* could not be produced;
 *   dependency updates that already succeeded are not worth a red job.
 * - The gate must never *pass* because a report could not be produced.
 *   `@effected/workspaces` is explicit: both `unverified` reasons mean fail
 *   closed. So a failed rules lookup degrades into an unverified report, and an
 *   unverified report withholds auto-merge.
 *
 * **Why the rules lookup is not optional.** `PeerCheck.run(lockfile)` without
 * `peerDependencyRules` always reports `peerRulesNotApplied`, because pnpm
 * persists resolution-affecting config into the lockfile and discards
 * reporting-affecting config — `peerDependencyRules` appears nowhere in a
 * lockfile. Supplying them is what makes a verdict possible at all, and
 * supplying `NoPeerDependencyRules` is an assertion ("I looked, there are
 * none"), not a default.
 *
 * **The same holds for the workspace join.** A `link:` edge to a workspace
 * member is judged only once `workspacePackages` joins it to that member's
 * manifest; without them every such edge is `unresolvedEdge`, which withheld
 * auto-merge from every pnpm monorepo with internal dependencies. `catalogs`
 * resolves a member's `catalog:` peer ranges, else `peerRangeUnresolved`. Each
 * lookup that fails omits its key -- PeerCheck then marks the report -- rather
 * than supplying an empty stand-in that would assert there is nothing to join.
