 * catalogs are written to disk — and a later run cannot then tell a deliberate
 * user override from an entry the action itself wrote. Diffing against `base`
 * (the catalogs of the version that was previously installed) separates them:
 *
 * - a key the disk still agrees with `base` on is ours, so it takes `next`'s
 *   value, and is deleted when `next` drops it;
 * - a key whose disk value diverges from `base` is the user's, and survives —
 *   even if upstream dropped it;
 * - a key absent from the disk is added.
 *
 * Only catalog names present in `base` or `next` are considered. A catalog name
 * no config dependency ships belongs to the consumer and is never touched.
 *
 * A `"kept"` delta means exactly one thing: a user override or user addition
 * survived the merge. An entry that is ours and simply did not move in this
 * release is not news — it produces no delta at all, rather than a `"kept"`
 * entry that would be indistinguishable from a real override.

 * @param disk - Catalogs currently in the manifest.
 * @param next - Catalogs shipped by the version being installed.
