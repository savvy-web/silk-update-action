/**
 * The action's domain schemas, and the `result` output contract built from them.
 *
 * Each schema derives its TypeScript type via `typeof Schema.Type`, so the type
 * and the validator cannot drift. {@link RunResultDocument} composes the same
 * schemas the run already produces rather than restating them in a parallel
 * reporting shape — two shapes would diverge, and the divergence would be
 * invisible because both would still serialize.
 *
 * **Every shared schema carries an explicit `identifier` annotation.** The
 * lowering hoists a sub-schema used in more than one place into `$defs` and
 * invents a *positional* name when there is none, so a second anonymous union
 * silently renames the first in a document published at a public `$id`. A
 * `$defs` key matching `Union_`/`Struct_` is a missing annotation here, not an
 * artifact to commit.
 *
 * The JSON Schema is generated from {@link RunResultDocument} by the
 * `schemastore` CLI (`lib/scripts/schemastore.config.ts`) into
 * `schemas/<label>/output.json`; `pnpm schema:check` fails CI when the
 * committed document is stale. Change the contract by editing these types and
 * running `pnpm schema:build`; never by editing the emitted JSON.
 *
 * **Every struct here is published as a CLOSED object (`additionalProperties:
 * false`)** — `@effected/schemastore`'s default lowering, which is stricter
 * than core's. Adding a field is therefore a breaking change to the document a
 * consumer validates against, which is why the schema label in
 * `./hosted.ts` is the action's NEXT major.
 *

 *   `| pnpm | config | … |` into consumers' pull requests, claiming pnpm was a
 *   config dependency (live: spencerbeggs/std-osc8#65)

 * fails the build. Upstream's vocabulary also carries "workspace", which this
