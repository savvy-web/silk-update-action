/**
 * CatalogConfigDeps - reproduce pnpm's config-dependency workflow for bun.
 *
 * pnpm reads config dependencies from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and merges each
 * one's catalogs in memory at install time. bun has no such concept: the
 * package named in the `config-dependencies` input is an ordinary dependency of
 * the root manifest, so this service fetches its module, reads its `catalogs`
 * export, and merges it into the manifest's own top-level `catalog` (the default
 * catalog) and `catalogs` (the named ones) fields — siblings of `workspaces`,
 * not nested inside it, which is where bun reads them from. The manifest becomes
 * the merged artifact. A nested `workspaces.catalog` / `workspaces.catalogs`
 * copy is still read (a repo may have been written that way) and is migrated to
 * the top level on write — see `utils/catalogs.ts`.
 *
 * Because the merge is written to disk rather than recomputed each install, a
 * later run cannot tell a deliberate user override from an entry the action
 * itself wrote. `threeWayMergeCatalogs` separates them by diffing against the
 * catalogs of the version that was actually installed last run — which is what
 * the lockfile records, hence the `LockfileReader` dependency.
 *
 * Nothing here is fatal except a manifest that cannot be read or written: any
 * per-dependency failure warns and skips that dependency, and the rest proceed.
 *
