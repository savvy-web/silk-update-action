/**
 * Release-age gate: the effective pnpm `minimumReleaseAge` policy, mirrored at
 * resolution time.
 *
 * pnpm rejects versions published inside the cutoff window at install
 * (`ERR_PNPM_NO_MATURE_MATCHING_VERSION`). The action applies the same gate
 * when resolving, so it never proposes a version pnpm would refuse.
 *
 * **Discovery belongs to `@effected/workspaces`.** `WorkspaceCatalogs.releaseAgeGate()`
 * combines the inline `pnpm-workspace.yaml` keys with the replayed
 * config-dependency `pnpmfile` hooks, strictest-wins, off the same single read it
 * uses for the catalog set. Replaying hooks matters because `pnpm config get`
 * does not, so a repo receiving its settings through a config dependency can
 * only be read that way.
 *
 * The hook replay must run in a **subprocess** — `layerWithConfigDependenciesSubprocess`,
 * not `layerWithConfigDependencies` — because rspack miscompiles a computed
 * dynamic `import()` into a context module (see the `action.config.ts` note on
 * `nativeDynamicImports`). The subprocess variant passes a static script via
 * argv, so nothing computed enters the bundle graph. It also keeps
 * config-dependency code out of the action's own process.
 *
 * **What stays local is the fail-open posture.** The kit fails *typed* with
 * `CatalogAssemblyFailure`, which is correct for a library. This action instead
 * degrades to "no gate" with a warning, because pnpm re-enforces the gate at
 * install and the worst case of missing data is exactly the pre-gate behavior —
 * whereas aborting a dependency-update run over an unreadable workspace file
 * would be a strictly worse trade. That wrapper is at the one call site in
 * `ReleaseAge.layer`.
