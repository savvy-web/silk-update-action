/**
 * ModuleCatalogs - read a config dependency's `catalogs` export from its
 * published tarball.
 *
 * A config dependency ships a map of catalogs as a named (or default) export.
 * pnpm's own config-dependency mechanism reads this out of the installed
 * package, but the catalog merge in this action has to happen *before* any
 * install runs (its output feeds the manifest that install then reads).
 * `fetchModuleCatalogs` closes that gap: it downloads the exact version being
 * written into the manifest, extracts the tarball with `tar` (present on
 * every GitHub runner image, so this needs no new dependency), and imports
 * the extracted `index.js` directly off disk — self-contained, no
 * `node_modules` required.
 *
 * This is a standalone exported function (like `syncPeers`), not a
 * `Context.Tag` service — it has no state and one caller.
 *
 * @module services/module-catalogs
