/**
 * PackageManagerUpgrade service for package-manager self-upgrade operations.
 *
 * Generalizes the pnpm-only `PnpmUpgrade` service to any package manager this
 * action supports (`SupportedPm`: pnpm, bun, npm). All three are published on
 * npm, so the same registry lookup and range logic apply unchanged; the only
 * behavioral difference is the write format.
 *
 * Reads the package-manager version from the `packageManager` and
 * `devEngines.packageManager` fields (favoring devEngines) and upgrades it
 * according to the `upgrade-package-manager` mode: "false" (skip), "true"/"auto" (latest
 * within the current major), or a semver range (may cross majors, and adds a
 * `packageManager` field when none exists). A `packageManager` or
 * `devEngines.packageManager` entry that names a *different* package manager
 * than the one being upgraded is not a reference for this run and is ignored.
 *
 * pnpm and npm are corepack-managed: corepack reads the `packageManager`
 * field and verifies its `+sha512.<hex>` hash, so the resolved version is
 * written directly into both fields as a pinned `version+sha512.<hex>`
 * string (derived from the npm registry integrity) — no `corepack use` is
 * invoked. Writing the fields does NOT activate the new version: the runtime
 * action put a version-pinned shim directory on `PATH` (there is no corepack
 * on the runner any more), so `pnpm` keeps answering as the OLD version until
 * `steps/activate-package-manager` provisions the resolved `pin` and the
 * install runs with its bin directory ahead on `PATH`. Relying on pnpm's own
 * `manage-package-manager-versions` self-switch is not enough — in a
 * workspace whose `devEngines.packageManager` carries `onFail: ignore`, a
 * pnpm 11 `install` ran and wrote the lockfile as 11 after the pin said 12
 * (savvy-web/pnpm-module-template#196). bun is NOT corepack-managed — it is
 * installed by its own toolchain and never consults `packageManager` — so it
 * is written as a bare `bun@<version>` with no hash suffix, and the integrity
 * fetch is skipped entirely (a wasted registry round-trip otherwise). No
 * range operator is written for corepack-managed pms because a hash-pinned
 * value is inherently exact.
 *
 * `upgrade()` always resolves to an outcome (never `null`) so a caller can
 * report *why* nothing happened — "disabled", "no reference", "nothing
 * satisfies the range" and "already current" are distinct outcomes, not one
 * silent no-op. This matters because `upgrade-package-manager` is a range
 * typed for one package manager (frequently copy-pasted from another repo)
 * while the workspace has been detected as a different one: a pnpm range in
 * a bun repo resolves against bun's release list and, correctly, satisfies
 * nothing — that must read as "no bun release satisfies the range", not
 * "bun is already up-to-date".

 * being upgraded (e.g. `packageManager: "npm@10.0.0"` while upgrading bun) —
 * all of which mean the same thing here: no reference for this run.
 *
 * `bare` is how the two fields differ. `packageManager` carries the whole
 * corepack pin (`` `${pm}@<version>[+<integrity>]` ``); `devEngines.packageManager.version`
 * carries only the version tail, so the manager name is prepended to give the
 * one grammar the whole pin it parses.
 *
 * **The grammar is `@effected/npm`'s `PackageManagerPin`, not a local regex.**
 * The predecessor tested `/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+/` against the tail — a *prefix* match
 * — and returned the whole trailing string, so `pnpm@11.12.0garbage` became a
 * reference and the synthesized `^11.12.0garbage` range then reported
 * `unsatisfiable`, which is this service's diagnosis for a range typed for a
 * *different* package manager. A malformed integrity tail was likewise split off
 * and discarded in silence. It also returned `hasCaret` and `hasSha` alongside
 * the version, neither of which had a reader anywhere: the same
 * declared-never-consumed shape that deleted four error classes and the pnpm
 * version helpers.
 *
 * **A leading range operator is still stripped, deliberately, and only for
 * `devEngines`.** A range is illegal in a corepack pin — the pin grammar
 * rejects it, and so does corepack — but `devEngines.packageManager.version` is
 * specified to accept one, and repos write `^11.0.0` there. Handing that
 * straight to the pin grammar would report "no reference" and silently stop
 * upgrading a manager the repo plainly declares. The operator is dropped rather
 * than resolved because the reference is only ever used as the anchor a target
 * range is synthesized from.
