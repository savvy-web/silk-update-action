/**
 * RuntimeUpgrade service for devEngines.runtime upgrades.
 *
 * Reads the root package.json, resolves the latest version satisfying a target
 * range (per runtime) via runtime-resolver, and writes the resolved version
 * back into the existing devEngines.runtime entry — preserving the object/array
 * shape. Mirrors PackageManagerUpgrade; resolver failures are caught and
 * skipped per-runtime, never fatal.
 *
 * Two rules govern the write:
 *
 * 1. **Upgrade only, never add.** These inputs upgrade the runtimes a repo
 *    already declares; they do not introduce new ones. When no
 *    `devEngines.runtime` entry exists for the runtime there is nothing to
 *    upgrade, so it is skipped with a warning — in *every* mode, `auto` and
 *    explicit range alike. (An earlier version let an explicit range add a
 *    missing entry, so a bun-only repo passing `upgrade-runtime-node` grew a
 *    node entry it never asked for.)
 * 2. **Always write an exact version.** The range — the existing entry's own
 *    version under `auto`, or the user-typed input range — only selects *which
 *    line to resolve*; the value written is always the bare resolved version,
 *    with no range operator. Downstream consumers of `devEngines.runtime`
 *    (notably silk-runtime-action, the next step in the pipeline) do not
 *    support range operators, so any operator written here is a latent failure
 *    downstream. An existing `"^24.0.0"` therefore resolves within `^24.0.0`
 *    and is rewritten as e.g. `"24.9.1"`.
