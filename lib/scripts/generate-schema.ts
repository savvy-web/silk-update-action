/**
 * Generate the JSON Schema for the action's structured `result` output.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `RunResultDocument` in `src/schema/domain.ts` is the single source of truth.
 * This script serialises it to a SchemaStore-compatible document at
 * `docs/schema/run-result.schema.json`, which `action.yml`'s `result`
 * description points at.
 *
 * Everything below {@link targets} belongs to `@effected/schemastore`:
 * `SchemaPipeline.run` builds the document, runs the structural lint and the
 * shipped ajv strict-mode gate, fails with a `SchemaGateError` carrying every
 * blocking finding, and writes only what passes — through `CanonicalJson`, and
 * only when the document's **content** differs. This script supplies the target
 * and the log wording; the package deliberately never logs.
 *
 * Because the comparison is by content rather than bytes, the generated file
 * needs no formatter carve-out: a formatter reflowing it does not provoke a
 * rewrite on the next run.
 *
 * Gating uses the pipeline's default blocking predicate — `warning` severity
 * fails the run, since each such finding means a document that would be broken
 * for the editors it exists to serve. `advisory` findings survive the gate and
 * are logged here.
 *
 * **Location matters.** This lives in `lib/scripts/`, not `scripts/`, because
 * that path is cache-invalidating for turbo — a generated artifact whose
 * generator changes must not be served from a stale cache.
 *
 * Run via `pnpm generate-schema`. The committed output is guarded against drift
 * by `__test__/unit/generate-schema.test.ts`, which imports {@link targets} and
 * uses `SchemaPipeline.check` — the identical walk, without writing.

 * Every struct in this document is published as a **closed** object
 * (`additionalProperties: false`); `RunResultDocument.schemaVersion`'s own
 * description relies on that strictness — it is what makes adding a field a
 * breaking change here. Core flipped the lowering's default to `"ignore"`
 * (open objects) on the rc line, so the contract has to be stated on the
 * target rather than inherited from whatever the installed `effect` defaults
 * to. Set here, on the shared target, so the drift test and the generator
