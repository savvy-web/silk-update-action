 * in isolation — every branch of `PackageManagerUpgradeOutcome`, including the
 * ones the composition suite only exercises for pnpm.
 *
 * The level assertions are the point: `unsatisfiable` is the one non-benign skip
 * and must warn, while `disabled` / `already-current` must stay at info. A run
 * that scrolls an acceptance signal past at the same level as a routine skip is
 * the failure this distinction exists to prevent.

/**
 * Capture the log stream with its levels — and count service invocations.
 *
 * The count exists because the disabled-path assertion is otherwise vacuous: the
 * result shape a short-circuit produces is one a *called* service could return
 * identically, so asserting the shape alone cannot tell "never called" from
 * "called and answered that". Only the call count discriminates.
