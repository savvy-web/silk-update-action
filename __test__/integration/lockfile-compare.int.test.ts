/**
 * Integration tests for the lockfile capture/compare pair against real
 * before/after lockfiles, parsed through workspaces-effect.
 *
 * The pnpm case proves that root-importer changes resolve to the root package's
 * actual name (not the literal "."). The bun case proves the diff is genuinely
 * package-manager agnostic: a bun repo has no pnpm-lock.yaml at all, so the
 * previous @pnpm/lockfile.fs-based reader captured nothing and reported an empty
 * diff.
