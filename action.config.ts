		// serializers/validators and draft-2019 JSON validators — that this
		// action never invokes. They aren't installed and would never be
		// present in the deployed action, so `ignore` (alias to a throwing
		// stub) is correct here, not `externals` (which means "available at
		// runtime"). cyclonedx's `_optPlug` wrapper try/catches the stub throw
		// and falls through gracefully.

		// Packages that perform a fully dynamic `await import(expr)` at
		// runtime. Without this, rspack compiles the import into a context
		// module and the action throws `Cannot find module 'file:///…'` in
		// production even though the file exists.
		// `@changesets/apply-release-plan` loads the configured changelog
		// module this way (via silk-effects 3's changesets v3 engine).
		// `@effected/workspaces`'s ConfigDependencyHooks loader has the same
		// computed `import(candidateUrl)` pattern and IS reachable in this bundle
		// (via WorkspaceCatalogs), so rspack emits a "Critical dependency" warning
		// and compiles it into a context module. It is deliberately NOT listed
		// here: registering it makes the builder's webpack-ignore loader throw on
		// that file (`hasTraversalSegment`) and fails the whole build. The warning
		// is inert unless the config-dependency-hooks path is actually invoked at
		// runtime — this action reads workspace/lockfile structure
		// (WorkspaceDiscovery / LockfileReader / PackageManagerDetector), it does
		// not load pnpmfile config-dependency hooks. TODO: confirm at runtime, or
		// fix upstream (@effected/workspaces webpackIgnore its own loader, or the
		// builder's ignore loader tolerate it).
		//
		// A third, different case: `src/services/module-catalogs.ts` (Task 5)
		// dynamically imports a config dependency's extracted tarball entry —
		// a path computed at runtime from a temp directory, not a package
		// specifier. This option's rule-building only matches resolved paths
		// under `node_modules/<name>/` (see `services/native-dynamic-imports.ts`
		// in the builder), so it structurally cannot target first-party source
		// under `src/`. That call site instead carries its own inline
		// `/* webpackIgnore: true */` magic comment ahead of the `import(...)`
		// call — the same fix this loader injects for the packages listed
		// above, just written directly since there's no third-party module
		// path to match against here. `module-catalogs.ts` is reachable from
		// `dist/main.js` (via `CatalogConfigDeps`), and because a context-module
		// rewrite only fails in production — vitest runs the source, not the
		// bundle — `build:prod` runs `scripts/assert-native-dynamic-import.mjs`
		// after every build, asserting the built `dist/main.js` still holds a
		// genuine `await import(<ident>)` at that call site and not a numbered
		// context module. Deleting the magic comment fails the build.
