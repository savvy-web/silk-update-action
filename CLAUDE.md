# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a **GitHub Action** that updates config dependencies, regular and peer
dependencies, the package manager itself, and `devEngines.runtime` entries
(node/deno/bun). It runs as **three phases**: `src/pre.ts` provisions the GitHub
App token (`GitHubToken.provision`), `src/main.ts` is a thin `Action.run(program)`
wrapper, `src/post.ts` reports duration and revokes the token. `src/program.ts`
holds `program` / `innerProgram` as **pure composition** — read inputs, run the
steps in order, fold their results into outputs, report; each step's body lives
in its own module under `src/steps/`, input reading in `src/schema/inputs.ts`
(`readInputs`), log rendering in `src/format.ts`. Cross-phase state in
`src/state.ts`.

It runs on **Effect v4** (via `catalog:effect`, injected by the
`@effected/pnpm-plugin-effect` config dependency — the line has crossed from
`beta` into `rc`, so **read the version off the tree**
(`node -p "require('./node_modules/effect/package.json').version"`) rather than
off any doc, this one included) and the **`@effected/*` kit**; the former all-in-one `@savvy-web/github-action-effects` is **deleted**,
its surface split across the kit packages. Domain logic is wrapped as Effect
services (`Context.Service` + `Layer`) in `src/services/`, wired by
`makeAppLayer(dryRun, { runtimeLive })` in `src/layers/app.ts`.

The **package manager is detected once per run** (`detectPackageManager`) and
every dispatch point routes on that one value. pnpm, bun and npm are supported;
yarn is rejected with `InvalidInputError`.

## Architecture

### Repository Structure

- Single-package GitHub Action (not a monorepo); no barrel re-exports — direct
  imports everywhere
- **Entry points**: `src/pre.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `src/post.ts` (derived from
  `action.config.ts` by the builder); composition in `src/program.ts`
- **Steps**: `src/steps/` — one module per orchestration unit (16: `branch`,
  `changesets`, `commit-and-pr`, `config-dependencies`, `configure-status`,
  `custom-commands`, `detect-changes`, `detect-package-manager`,
  `format-workspace`, `install`, `lockfile-snapshot`, `peer-check`, `peer-sync`,
  `regular-dependencies`, `upgrade-package-manager`, `upgrade-runtimes`). Each
  declares its own result type, an explicit requirement channel, and a tagged
  error **only if it can actually fail** — **five** carry `never` (`peer-check`
  is the newest; do not carry the old count of four forward without re-reading
  the signatures)
- **Services**: `src/services/` — `Context.Service` + `Layer`, plus stateless
  helper modules; **Layers**: `src/layers/app.ts`; **Schema**: `src/schema/`
  (singular — `domain.ts`, `inputs.ts`, `outputs.ts`); **Rendering**:
  `src/format.ts` (the run's log surface — pure, no services); **Errors**:
  `src/errors/errors.ts`; **Utils**: `src/utils/` (pure helpers)
- **Tests**: `__test__/unit/**` mirrors `src/`; `__test__/integration/**` for
  real-IO suites; `__test__/utils/**` for shared helpers (see Gotchas)
- **Shared configs**: `lib/configs/`; **Build**: Turbo; `typecheck` needs `build`

### Effect-TS Patterns

Service and layer inventory — which kit package owns which service, the domain
service list, Effect v4 spellings, the token lifecycle:
-> @./CLAUDE.effect-kit.md

Load before wiring or editing a service or layer, or when a kit API is not where
you expect. The two Effect hazards that bite *without* being looked up — the
`Action.run` requirement-channel hole and the `Schema.TaggedError` rename — are
in **Gotchas** below, not behind that pointer.

### Dogfooding, Branching and Release

Linking/overriding a first-party dep, the `dev` -> `main` -> release flow, and
the two workflows that clobber `dev`:
-> @./CLAUDE.workflow.md

**`dev` IS the feature branch here** — feature work is committed directly to it
with ordinary commits, because the action is bundled and a consumer pinning
`@dev` runs the **committed `dist`**, so nothing else can be tested end to end.
That makes **rewriting `dev` wrong** — no squash, no force-push, no rebase — and
`/design-docs:finalize` in particular: it soft-resets to the merge base and
pushes, which on an in-sync `dev` means force-pushing a branch other repositories'
CI is pinned to. A **`dev` → `main` PR is the intended finalization**, not a
prohibited one; GitHub squashes at merge without rewriting the branch first.

Load before linking a dependency, cutting a release, **finalizing or promoting a
branch**, or editing `.github/workflows/**`. **Currently nothing is linked and there are no
`overrides` entries** — if you were only checking that, you now have the answer
and do not need the pointer.

## Testing

- **Framework**: Vitest with v8 coverage, forks pool (Effect compatibility).
  Current suite: **643 tests across 44 files**, measured, not carried forward.
  **Treat a test count here as evidence and re-derive it** (`pnpm vitest run`) — a
  figure this line once carried was never a real count, having been edited by a
  plausible `+1` in the very commit that invalidated it, which is what made it
  credible. Per-commit accounting in
  `@./.claude/design/silk-update-action/08-testing.md`.
  `@effect/vitest` reads `catalog:effect`, the same
  catalog entry as `effect`, so the required lockstep is maintained by the catalog
  rather than by remembering to bump a literal; a few suites use `it.effect`,
  real-IO suites deliberately do not.
- **Schema drift**: `__test__/unit/generate-schema.test.ts` fails when
  `docs/schema/run-result.schema.json` no longer matches `RunResultDocument`; fix
  by running `pnpm generate-schema`, not by editing the JSON.
- **Config**: `vitest.config.ts` is an async factory loading `@vitest-agent/plugin`
  — `AgentPlugin.discover()` supplies `projects`/`tags`, `AgentPlugin({...})` is
  registered in `plugins`.
- **Coverage gate**: `AgentPlugin.COVERAGE_LEVELS.strict` (`coverageTargets` on
  the plugin, `.thresholds` on `test.coverage`, `exclude: []`) — **aggregate**
  minimums, **not** a per-file gate and nowhere near 100%. An entire module can
  have **zero** test execution while the run stays green (exactly how
  `innerProgram` and the bare-`Config` regression shipped). Verify by **fault
  injection**: throw inside the path and confirm a test fails.

## Conventions

- `.js` extensions on relative imports (ESM); `node:` protocol for built-ins;
  separate `import type`
- Commits: conventional format, DCO signoff, no markdown in the body (commitlint
  `silk/body-no-markdown`)

## Gotchas

- Biome enforces **tabs**, not spaces
- **`Schema.TaggedError`, not `Schema.TaggedErrorClass`.** The `*Class` spelling
  existed only on the earlier v4 betas and was renamed back to the v3 name in
  `beta.107`; the curried shape is identical, so the fix is the name alone. Worth
  knowing how it presents, because the shape recurs on every advance: the four
  class declarations in `src/errors/errors.ts` are the *only* real breakage, but
  their base type collapses, so every `new SomeError({...})` reports "Expected 0
  arguments, but got 1" and every field getter reports a missing property — 50
  errors across 14 files, in modules that never mention the renamed API. **An
  advance whose error list is dominated by call sites is still, usually, a
  declaration-site problem: find the declaration before touching a single call
  site.**
- **Read inputs with `ActionInput.*`, never bare `Config`.** The runner exports
  inputs as `INPUT_*` (only spaces mangled), so `Config.string("dependencies")`
  resolves nothing and silently takes its `withDefault` — including `dry-run`, so a
  rehearsal performs a live run. `ActionInput.list` owns the multi-value grammar
  (`src/utils/input.ts` / `parseMultiValueInput` are **deleted**) and **fails on
  absent and empty**, so `Config.withDefault([])` on each list read is load-bearing.
  `readInputs` lives in `src/schema/inputs.ts` (beside the `INPUT_NAMES` tuple)
  and is pinned by `INPUT_*`-keyed tests.
- **A service `makeAppLayer` does not provide is NOT a type error.** Same class as
  the entry above — a framework surface that silently accepts a wrong call.
  `Action.run` is declared `<E, R = never>(program: Effect<void, E,
  ActionServices | R>, options?: ActionRunOptions<R>)`; `options` is **optional**,
  so `R` infers to whatever is left over and `Action.run(program)` typechecks at
  *any* leftover requirement. There is no "you forgot a layer" error, ever. So a
  service resolved in a **domain layer's body** that `makeAppLayer` does not
  provide ships under a clean `tsc` and a green suite and dies on the runner as a
  defect ~30ms in — **before the check run is created**, so nothing appears in the
  GitHub UI. Not hypothetical: v4.6.0 shipped with `PackageJsonFile` provided to
  `RuntimeUpgrade.layer` only and failed 100% of runs in every consumer repo. The
  only thing standing between that and the next release is
  **`__test__/unit/layers/app.test.ts`**, a compile-time assertion that
  `Exclude<AppLayerRequirements, ActionServices>` is `never` — it fails
  `pnpm typecheck`, and the error names the missing service. **So adopting a
  service into a second consumer is a layer-wiring change, not a call-site
  change.** Its blind spots, so it is not over-trusted: it catches *missing*
  wiring, not *broken* wiring (nothing builds the graph), and a service resolved
  in a **method** rather than a layer body never reaches the requirement channel
  at all. **That third blind spot has now fired in production too**, so the guard
  has a SECOND assertion: `Exclude<InnerProgramRequirements, ActionServices>`
  must also be `never`. `steps/peer-check.ts` resolves `WorkspaceCatalogs` in its
  step body, `makeAppLayer` built that layer but piped it into `ReleaseAge`
  **without merging it into the returned layer**, and the run died with
  `Service not found: @effected/workspaces/WorkspaceCatalogs`. The layer-side
  assertion could not see it — it checks the layer's **input** channel, and this
  is a missing **output**. Both halves are mutation-verified; the second names
  `WorkspaceCatalogs` when reinstated. **A service built inside `makeAppLayer` is
  not thereby provided — check it appears in a `mergeAll`, not merely in a
  `Layer.provide`.** Depth in
  `@./.claude/design/silk-update-action/06-effect-patterns.md`
- **The `result` output is the whole run as JSON** (`RunResultDocument`, composed
  from the existing domain schemas rather than a parallel reporting shape),
  emitted **on every exit path** as an empty-run document — never an empty
  string, so a consumer parses unconditionally. Its JSON Schema is **generated**
  into `docs/schema/run-result.schema.json` by `lib/scripts/generate-schema.ts`
  (via `@effected/schemastore`, run under `tsx` — a declared
  devDependency, previously transitive-only); change it by editing the domain
  types and running `pnpm generate-schema`. The four scalar outputs are
  unchanged.
  - **The structs are closed (`additionalProperties: false`) because the
    generator's `SchemaTarget` says `jsonSchema: { onExcessProperty: "error" }`,
    not because the lowering defaults to it** — it stopped defaulting to it at
    `effect@4.0.0-rc.113`. If `pnpm generate-schema` ever flips every struct to
    `additionalProperties: true` (the drift test reports `contract`), the option
    has been lost from `lib/scripts/generate-schema.ts`; restore it there and do
    not commit the permissive output.
  - **Every shared schema needs an explicit `identifier` annotation.** From
    beta.107 the lowering hoists a sub-schema used in more than one place into
    `$defs` and invents a *positional* name when there is none — so a second
    anonymous union silently renames the first. Nothing fails, which is why this
    needs a rule: **a `$defs` key matching `Union_`/`Struct_` is a missing
    annotation at the definition site, not an artifact to commit.** Depth in
    `@./.claude/design/silk-update-action/03-type-definitions.md`
- **Tests are not co-located**: every unit suite lives in `__test__/unit/**`
  mirroring `src/`. `utils`, `fixtures` and `snapshots` are reserved for helpers
  and mocks and must never hold a `.test.ts` — an excluded suite silently never
  runs and the aggregate coverage gate stays green. Keep helpers as plain `.ts`
  in `__test__/utils/`, pinned from `__test__/unit/doubles.test.ts`. **Tests for
  `src/utils/` live in `__test__/unit/utilities/`, not `__test__/unit/utils/`.**
  - **This entry used to say the reservation applies "at ANY depth under
    `__test__`, not just the top level", citing
    `segments.slice(1,-1).some(...)` in `@vitest-agent/sdk`. Both halves are
    wrong.** `@vitest-agent/sdk` is not installed here (only `cli`, `mcp` and
    `plugin` are), and the installed plugin excludes only the **direct child of
    `__test__`**. Measured by probe, which is the only method that settles it:
    a planted `probe.test.ts` under `__test__/unit/steps/fixtures/__probe__/`
    and under `__test__/unit/utils/__probe__/` is **collected**; one under
    `__test__/fixtures/__probe__/` is not. Re-derive with
    `pnpm exec vitest list --filesOnly`, never by reading a rule out of a doc.
  - **What holds the convention up is this repo's own guard, not the runner.**
    `__test__/unit/test-collection.test.ts` applies the any-depth rule itself,
    so it is deliberately **stricter** than the plugin. That is fail-safe — it
    can only over-exclude — and it is why nothing is broken despite the doc
    having been wrong.
  - **The 580 → 478 drop is therefore UNEXPLAINED, not explained.** It is
    recorded as five suites under `__test__/unit/utils/` silently not being
    collected; under the measured rule they would have been collected. Either
    the plugin changed since or the mechanism was something else. Do not cite
    that incident as evidence for the depth rule.
- **`vitest.setup.ts` strips every runner-owned prefix before any suite runs** —
  `INPUT_`, `GITHUB_`, `RUNNER_`, `ACTIONS_` and now **`STATE_`**. The last is the
  sharpest of the five: `ActionState` reads exactly those pairs, so a fixture that
  forgets to seed its own state reads the **host** workflow's persisted state,
  decodes it successfully, and passes on someone else's data.
- `@actions/*` is never imported; the head SHA comes from `ActionEnvironment`
  (`env.github.sha`), the log level from `env.isDebug`
- Action input is `app-client-id` (not `app-id`); `post.ts` always revokes
- `source-branch` (default `main`) is the cut-from ref; `target-branch` (empty →
  follows source, via `resolveTargetBranch`) is the PR base. Both are validated by
  `BranchManager.validateBranches` **inside the check run**, before the branch is
  force-reset by `GitBranch.upsert`
- Changesets need local history for the base ref: the checkout must use
  `fetch-depth: 0`, and `BranchManager.ensureBaseHistory(target)` is a best-effort
  preflight before `Changesets.create`
- `upgrade-package-manager` is a **string** input (`false` | `true` | `auto` | a
  semver range) defaulting to **`"false"`** (opt-in, matching `upgrade-runtime-*`).
  It upgrades the **detected** manager via `PackageManagerUpgrade`. corepack-managed
  managers (pnpm, npm) are written hash-pinned (`+sha512.<hex>`, via
  `@effected/npm`'s `CorepackIntegrityHash.fromSri`) into both `packageManager` and
  `devEngines.packageManager.version`; **bun is written bare** (corepack does not
  manage it). `upgrade()` never returns `null` — it returns an outcome whose `kind`
  explains the skip, and `unsatisfiable` (a range typed for a different manager)
  is the only one logged at **warning**. A successful upgrade opens the install gate
- `runInstall` (`src/steps/install.ts`; `runCommands` is in
  `src/steps/custom-commands.ts`) **regenerates** the lockfile rather than
  repairing it (pnpm:
  `pnpm clean --lockfile` + `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false`, needs pnpm 11+;
  bun: `bun install --force`; npm: unlink `package-lock.json` via `node:fs` then
  `npm install`) — the action mutates all three resolution inputs, so a repair-only
  install could commit an inconsistent lockfile. Advancing transitives is expected
- **`src/services/module-catalogs.ts` is down to the LOAD.** Fetching,
  integrity-verifying and extracting a config dependency's tarball is
  `@effected/npm`'s `PackageTarball.extract` (scoped — no local temp-dir
  cleanup), and entry resolution is `@effected/package-json`'s
  `resolveEntryPoint`; both were harvested out of this repo (effected#282).
  Only the `import()` of the resolved entry stays local, because a kit-level
  loader would hand every bundling consumer the context-module problem.
  `fetchModuleCatalogs` now returns a **discriminated** `ModuleCatalogs` outcome
  rather than `CatalogMap | null`, and that is a **bug fix, not tidying**:
  `CatalogConfigDeps` reads the *base* version's result to decide whether it has
  a merge base, so every failure arriving as one `null` meant an integrity
  mismatch was handled as a yanked version, took the lossy `pluginWinsMerge`
  path and **discarded a user's catalog override on a run that reported
  success**. Base routing is now `notFound` → plugin-wins, `noCatalogsExport` →
  three-way against an **empty** base (a first adoption, where every existing
  entry is the user's), everything else → **skip the dependency**. The middle
  two are NOT interchangeable — empty-base against a *yanked* base would freeze
  every entry and the plugin could never move again. Also note the entry
  resolver is now **stricter**: no `main`/`index.js` fallback when `exports`
  matches nothing (Node's encapsulation rule), which is unreachable for both
  config dependencies this repo consumes (no `main` at all) but not for an
  arbitrary consumer's. Depth in
  `@./.claude/design/silk-update-action/05-module-library.md`
- Config dependencies dispatch on the manager: **pnpm** edits
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`ConfigDeps`); **bun** three-way merges the dependency's
  `catalogs` export into `package.json` against the lockfile's installed version
  (`CatalogConfigDeps`, emitting `CatalogDelta` rows that reach the PR body);
  **npm** is skipped — no `catalog:` protocol
- `ConfigDeps`/`RegularDeps` mirror pnpm's `minimumReleaseAge` gate at resolution
  time via `ReleaseAge.filterVersions`, so the action never proposes a version pnpm
  would reject (`ERR_PNPM_NO_MATURE_MATCHING_VERSION`). **Gate discovery is the
  kit's**, not this repo's: `WorkspaceCatalogs.releaseAgeGate()` over
  **`layerWithConfigDependenciesSubprocess()`** — the subprocess variant is
  mandatory, because rspack miscompiles the in-process computed dynamic
  `import()` into a context module. **What stays local is the fail-open
  posture**: the kit fails typed with `CatalogAssemblyFailure` (right for a
  library), and this action degrades that to "no gate" with a warning in a
  one-line `Effect.catch` in `ReleaseAge.layer`, because pnpm re-enforces the
  gate at install anyway. Depth in
  `@./.claude/design/silk-update-action/05-module-library.md`
- Runtime bumps (`upgrade-runtime-*`) **upgrade only, never add** — in *every*
  mode — and always write the **bare exact** resolved version (the range only
  selects which line to resolve), because `silk-runtime-action` downstream rejects
  range operators. `auto` no-ops on a static pin. `@effected/runtimes` resolves only
  **non-EOL** major lines; an EOL target is skipped with a warning (offline and
  live alike). Runtime bumps never create a changeset and never trigger install
- `@effected/workspaces`' `PackageManagerDetector` recognizes bun/pnpm from the
  **lockfile conjoined with the manifest**, not `devEngines.packageManager` alone —
  a repo naming a manager only in `devEngines` with no lockfile detects as **npm**
- **`git status` is read through `@effected/git`'s `Git.status(cwd)`**, which
  returns typed `StatusEntry` values (`x`, `y`, `path`, `origPath`). Both readers
  use it — `services/branch.ts` (commit file list) and `steps/detect-changes.ts`
  (change verdict). `parseStatusLine` and the `gitRaw`/`Run.collect` helper it
  needed are **deleted**; `Run.text` still trims, but nothing here parses
  column-aligned text any more
- **`core.fileMode=false` is set once on the checkout, not per command.**
  `steps/configure-status.ts` writes it via `Git.configSet` right after detection,
  before any status read — exec-bit-only flips do not survive the content-based
  API commit at mode 100644 and would produce an empty commit and a spurious PR.
  Repository scope, so it also applies to silk's DepsRegen commands in that
  checkout (benign, and stated in the design docs rather than assumed)
- Auto-merge requires GraphQL (no REST endpoint) and is a **separate**
  `setAutoMerge` call whose failure degrades to a warning
- **`check-peers` gates auto-merge by NOT making that separate call.** Input is
  `false` | `warn` | `no-auto-merge`, and its **default is DERIVED** rather than
  static: unset resolves to `no-auto-merge` when `auto-merge` is enabled and
  `false` when it is not. A static `no-auto-merge` default would have been a
  no-op for the *gate* but not for the *run* — the step still spawns the
  config-dependency hook replay as a subprocess in the consumer's repo. Deriving
  makes "free where there is nothing to gate" literally true. An explicit value
  always wins. **Nothing can be withheld that was never going to happen:**
  `decidePeerGate` takes `autoMergeEnabled`, because without it the PR body told
  reviewers "auto-merge was withheld" on repositories that had never enabled it;
  `fail` is deliberately **rejected**, not accepted-and-ignored, because it is the
  only tier needing a second concurrent check run. The gate predicate is
  **not** `required > 0` — it is
  `supported && !unresolvedImporters.length && !unverified.length && !requiredCount`,
  because each of the other three produces an empty result meaning *"not examined"*
  rather than *"nothing wrong"*. A mutant reading only `requiredCount` turns five
  tests red, which is the check that this is real rather than decorative.
  - **The step calls `WorkspaceCatalogs.refresh()` before the rules read**, and
    the call is load-bearing, not hygiene: the assembly is memoized and first
    triggered by release-age discovery *before* the run installs, so without it
    the after-install lockfile is judged under the pre-install plugins' rules —
    a run that bumps the very plugin supplying the rules withholds auto-merge
    on rows the new plugin suppresses (live: pnpm-module-template#84/#85). An
    enabled run therefore replays the hook subprocess **twice**, deliberately;
    ordering is pinned by a test whose double only answers after `refresh()`.
  - **A lockfile alone cannot answer the question.** pnpm persists
    *resolution*-affecting config into the lockfile and discards
    *reporting*-affecting config: `overrides` from a pnpmfile **are** recorded,
    `peerDependencyRules` appears **zero** times (`pnpmfileChecksum` in the
    lockfile header is the tell — pnpm would have nothing to invalidate against if
    the lockfile were complete). So the rules come from
    `WorkspaceCatalogs.peerDependencyRules()`, which also replays
    config-dependency plugins — and **this repo declares no rules of its own**, so
    a workspace-file-only read would find nothing here and still false-positive.
  - **Presence of the option is the assertion, not its contents.** Omitting
    `peerDependencyRules` means "nobody looked" and always reports
    `peerRulesNotApplied`; passing `NoPeerDependencyRules` asserts "I looked, there
    are none". A failed lookup therefore degrades to **omitting**, never to the
    empty set — the empty set is a claim we would have no basis to make.
  - Stated limits, not implied coverage: optional peers never gate;
    a pnpm workspace package's **own** peer declarations are undetectable (absent
    from the lockfile, and `pnpm peers check` does not report them either); and
    `ignoreMissing`/`allowAny` are **not consumed upstream and fail closed** — a
    non-empty either axis makes the report `unverified`, so **the gate stops
    firing positively rather than answering wrongly**. Neither of this repo's two
    config-dependency plugins sets either axis today (verified from
    `peerDependencyRules()` output, not from the plugin sources:
    `allowedVersions` 36, both axes `[]`), so the gate is unaffected — but a
    plugin that starts setting one silently turns the gate into a permanent
    abstain, and that is deliberate, not a regression to chase
- **`@effected/package-json` is adopted for `PackageJsonFile.modify` ONLY** —
  a declared runtime dependency wired as `PackageJsonFile.layer` and
  consumed by both `RuntimeUpgrade` and `PackageManagerUpgrade`. This line used to
  read "evaluated and DECLINED — do not re-propose it"; that ruling was
  **narrowed, not overturned**, and the distinction is the content. Its central
  objection still governs: `Package.decode` requires `name` + a strict-semver
  `version`, so it **rejects the private workspace root** this action must edit.
  That is honored by *not using the decode path* — both services still
  `readFileSync` + `JSON.parse` to **decide**, routing only the **write** through
  `modify` (a decode-free JSONC edit at a field path; key order, indent and line
  endings survive byte-for-byte). What changed is upstream: `0.9.0` (PR
  spencerbeggs/effected#366) shipped the two things the old ruling named as its
  own falsification condition — a presence-lenient `PackageManifest` and an
  order-preserving single-field edit — answering **#286**. Nothing here noticed
  for a release, because "do not re-propose" is the sentence that stops the next
  reader checking. **Re-checking the ruling's four "therefore staying" helpers by
  call site deleted two of them**: `parsePnpmVersion` / `formatPnpmVersion` (and
  `ParsedPnpmVersion`) had no caller anywhere and the reason recorded for keeping
  them had independently expired, so they are **gone** from `src/utils/pnpm.ts`.
  That is the sequence worth copying — a doc pass that checks call sites is how
  dead exports get found, the same argument that removed four error classes. The
  per-helper verdicts (including why `detectIndent` stays but *not* for its
  recorded reason) are in
  `@./.claude/design/silk-update-action/09-project-status.md`; re-derive by grep
  rather than re-reading either list
- **`src/utils/pnpm.ts` is down to `detectIndent` alone**, and the two deletions
  happened for *different* reasons — do not collapse them. `parsePnpmVersion` /
  `formatPnpmVersion` went for having **no caller** (above).
  `corepackHashFromIntegrity` had a caller and worked; it went because the
  capability **moved upstream** (`@effected/npm`'s `CorepackIntegrityHash.fromSri`,
  issue #290 — effected#281 cites this repo's copy as the consumer evidence). The
  kit is not a like-for-like port: the local version base64-decoded whatever
  followed `sha512-`, so a wrong-length digest or non-canonical base64 became a
  pin that *looked* well-formed and that corepack rejects at install, in the
  consumer's repo, after a successful run. Those fail typed now and degrade to
  the bare-version write. **`PackageManagerUpgrade`'s module-private
  `parsePmVersion` went the same way**, onto `PackageManagerPin` — with one local
  concession: a leading `^`/`~` is stripped before parsing
  `devEngines.packageManager.version`, because devEngines legally carries a range
  and a corepack pin never does
- **The DCO sign-off comes from the persisted token, not a literal.**
  `src/utils/commit-signoff.ts`' `resolveSignoff()` reads
  `GitHubToken.botIdentity()` and renders through `BotIdentity.signoff`, falling
  back to `BotIdentity.githubActions`; `Report.layer` resolves it **once in the
  layer body** so the commit trailer and the PR body's proposed-squash fence
  cannot disagree, and so neither member gains an `ActionState` requirement. It
  replaced a `signoffLine(appSlug?)` whose slug branch **nothing ever passed** —
  reachable only from a test — so every real run signed as `github-actions[bot]`
  while the App bot authored the commit. Same shape as the sister
  `silk-release-action`'s `resolveSignoff`, deliberately
- **`@effected/git` is adopted for `status` only.** The mutating tier is still
  declined — it covers 2 of the 9 local git operations `services/branch.ts`
  performs, so seven stay on `Run` (spencerbeggs/effected#279). The earlier
  blanket decline rested on "`-c core.fileMode=false` cannot be scoped", which
  was **wrong**: that enumerated per-command and process-global and treated the
  list as exhaustive, when repository config is a third scope and the ordinary
  one. Worth remembering as a shape — every individual claim in that ruling was
  true. Detail and the "what would change the answer" conditions live in
  `@./.claude/design/silk-update-action/09-project-status.md`
- **A caret on a `0.x` dependency pins the minor.** `^0.9.5` does **not** admit
  `0.10.0`; `^0.2.1` does not admit `0.3.0`. A plain `pnpm update` therefore
  leaves a `0.x` kit package on the old minor while code calls the new surface —
  the install succeeds and the failure shows up later. Bump the declared range
  explicitly when a `0.x` kit package releases a minor. This is not theoretical:
  `@effected/workspaces` and `@effected/commands` both crossed a `0.x` minor and
  needed exactly that hand-edit; check the declared ranges rather than trusting
  the versions this line used to name.
  - **The trap has a second half — a range that is *satisfied* is a range pnpm
    never revisits**, so a lockfile can hold a version for months while its peers
    move. At `@effected/npm@0.11.0` that left `@effected/github` on `0.6.0` while
    `github-actions@0.9.1` pulled `0.7.0`, and
    `__test__/unit/layers/app.test.ts` failed with `Type 'boolean' is not
    assignable to type 'GitHubClient'`. **The duplicate was NOT the cause** — a
    `0.6.1`+`0.7.0` pair typechecks fine; `0.6.0` embeds `@octokit/types@16`
    where its peers were built against `@17`, and `GitHubClient`'s type embeds
    octokit's. So a duplicate is harmless while the copies' shapes agree, and it
    is a **stale transitive** that makes them disagree. Evidence table and the
    full write-up (including that the correct explanation was already on the page
    when the wrong one was added) in
    `@./.claude/design/silk-update-action/01-dependencies.md`. After any kit
    bump: `pnpm why` on **every** kit package, not just the one you bumped — and
    read a leftover requirement in the guard as *one of three* possible causes
    (missing `Layer.provide`, duplicate, drifted shape), since the message names
    the type and never the reason
- **`src/services/lockfile.ts` once held a raw NUL byte** (the `depKey`
  separator, since replaced by the `\0` escape). `file(1)` reported it as `data`
  and **grep silently skipped all 531 lines**, returning something
  indistinguishable from a clean no-match. Any pre-fix claim about that file may
  rest on no data at all; re-verify rather than cite
- `action.config.ts`: `build.nativeDynamicImports` lists
  `@changesets/apply-release-plan` only, so rspack preserves its fully dynamic
  `await import()`. `@effected/workspaces`' `ConfigDependencyHooks` has the same
  pattern but must **not** be listed — the builder's ignore-loader throws on that
  file. This line used to add "its 'Critical dependency' warning is benign"; there
  is **no warning any more**, because the installed `ConfigDependencyHooks.js`
  now carries its own inline `/* webpackIgnore: true */` (upstream
  spencerbeggs/effected#242) and rspack leaves the import native. If the warning
  ever returns, the fix is upstream, **not** an entry in this list. First-party
  dynamic imports use the same inline comment (`src/services/module-catalogs.ts`),
  asserted post-build by `scripts/assert-native-dynamic-import.mjs`.
  **`build.ignore` is DELETED, not "vestigial"** — which is what this line used
  to say, and it stayed pending long enough to be worth closing. It named
  three optional `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library` plugins that only ever arrived
  through the deleted `@savvy-web/github-action-effects`; cyclonedx now has
  **zero** occurrences in `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and rebuilding without the key changed
  `dist/main.js` by minifier variable renaming alone. Rationale in
  `@./.claude/design/silk-update-action/01-dependencies.md`
- **`persistLocal` stays DISABLED — a deliberate divergence from the kit canon,
  not an oversight, and the reason is recorded here so it is not "fixed".** The
  canon says enable it so a committed `.github/actions/local` can serve as an
  `act`/CI smoke target. Nothing in this repo runs `act`, and the cost is measured
  rather than assumed: the persisted copy is a **byte-for-byte duplicate** of
  `dist/`, so enabling it roughly **doubles** the ~2 MB payload every consumer
  downloads on every run. The dead scaffolding was removed rather than fed —
  `.actrc` and `.github/workflows/act-test.yml` are **deleted**, and that workflow
  could never have worked anyway: it did `uses: ./.github/actions/local`, a path
  this repo has never had. *Revisit when* something actually consumes the
  persisted output.
